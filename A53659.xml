            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A FURTHER

OF THE
DISSENTERS
FROM
Mr. GIPP's Unjuſt Accuſations.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">Containing ſome Animadverſions on his Firſt Chapter.</head>
               <p>IT had been obſerved of the Authors of the moſt inconſiſtent Un-truths, that
by often reporting them, they come at laſt to believe 'em themſelves, and
with a recollected Effrontery to recommend 'em to the eaſie World as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
and unconteſtable Verities:</p>
               <p>The Reverend <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> has given ſuch a diſcovery of
this Spirit as will hardly admit of a Parallel. In a Sermon of his he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
a vile Charge againſt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>Corrupting the Word of
God</hi> by Miſ-printing <hi>ye</hi> for <hi>we</hi> in Acts 6. 3. A Charge ſo black, ſo ſenſeleſs, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with their known Principles, ſo weakly grounded, that none but ſuch as
have abandon'd the <hi>Charity,</hi> which is Eſſential to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and ſacrificed the <hi>Reaſon</hi>
which conſtitutes a <hi>Man,</hi> to the abſurdeſt Prejudices, can entertain it under any
other Character, than that of a malitious and ſilly Calumny. I have fully proved
it to be ſuch in my <hi>Remarks</hi> on his Sermon, and have charitably call'd upon him to
give Glory to God, and conſult his own Peace in a dying Hour, by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Offence againſt God, in whoſe Name he hath publiſhed the Vileſt of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40622:3"/>
It would have contributed more to his preſent Reputation and future Comfort,
ingenuouſly to have retracted an <hi>uncharitable Preſumption,</hi> than to have attempted
to <hi>confirm</hi> his Charge, as he calls it, by a <hi>Defence</hi> of his Firſt Arguments which is
ſo very weak, that it not only convincingly <hi>Juſtifies</hi> the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> againſt his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
but <hi>condemns</hi> himſelf to be a Man that can aſſume the Liberty to
affirm any thing, be it never ſo falſe and abſurd, when it ſerves to expoſe an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Party. This will evidently appear when I have conſidered his <hi>Defence,</hi> and
the <hi>additional Proofs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſire the Reader to take Notice that it is <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> and not any point of
Controverſy, we are now upon, namely, <hi>whether the Presbyterians be Guilty of Corrupting
the Word of God?</hi> The Rector <hi>affirms</hi> it in his Sermon, and pretends to <hi>confirm</hi> it,
in his Defence of it. I doubt not but all Men, who have any regard to Truth or
commom Honeſty, will expect a very clear, direct proof of ſo High a Charge,
againſt a great Body of ſober People, and will not eaſily take uncharitable Suſpicious
for evident Proofs.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of a <hi>direct Proof,</hi> his Sermon produceth only a <hi>circumſtantial one.</hi> But
in his <hi>Remarks</hi> upon <hi>Remarks</hi> (as he ſtiles the defence of his Sermon) he pretends
to <hi>confirm his Charge,</hi> for thus his Title-Page runs, <q>The <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>Bury</hi>'s Charge
exhibited againſt the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for endeavouring to Corrupt the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
Juſtified and further Confirmed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When a Charge is <hi>Justified</hi> and <hi>Confirmed,</hi> the Proofs are ſuppoſed to be Clear and
Convincing; but you'l ſoon find your ſelves miſtaken if you expect any ſuch thing
in the Rectors <hi>Remarks.</hi> He <hi>affirms,</hi> with a brazen Coufidence, and <hi>confirms</hi> with
Leaden Arguments, whoſe main Edge conſiſts in the baſeſt Sort of Railing and
Calumny, againſt the living and the dead, and he gives it the <hi>Keenneſs</hi> that ſuch
<hi>Mettal</hi> is capable of by the vigorous Application of that <hi>Whetſtone</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
               <p>But let's hear how he confirms his Charge.</p>
               <p>1. Above thirty Pages of the ſixty four in his Book are on things Forreign to that
Charge, which is the main Thing he was to confirm, and a great Part of the reſt
of his Book is taken up in perſonal Reflections, which is a clear Evidence he wanted

of <hi>the Notes upon the Lord Biſhop of</hi> Saliſbury<hi>'s four laſt Diſcourſes.</hi>

               <p>I never cou'd certainly tell who was the <hi>Author</hi> of thoſe Notes which I have not
by me, and therefore can ſay nothing of 'em. If he retorts the Schiſm upon the
impoſers of unſcriptual Terms of Communion, as the Rector ſeems to hint, he wou'd
do well to anſwer his Arguments inſtead of branding him cauſeleſly, and in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Manner with <hi>ill Nature,</hi> want of <hi>good Breeding,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now his Hand is in, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> himſelf can't eſcape his Cenſure, whom he
takes upon him to <hi>correct</hi> for his too—gentle Expreſſions of the Diſſenters, and
wou'd have had him ſtyled them <hi>the Foxes and Firebrands of this Church and Nation,</hi>
that is he would teach the <hi>Judicious</hi> and <hi>Moderate</hi> Prelate to ſpeak the Language of
the <hi>confident and fiery</hi> Author of the Sermons of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> Here the Rector gives

He has pick'd up ſome imperfect Notes of an old Sermon of his, which has ſo
filled his Head, that his Reflections upon it is become the <hi>ſtanding Preface</hi> to all his
late Works. He mentions it in his <hi>Tentament Novum,</hi> here you find it again, and
becauſe you can't have too much of a good Thing, he promiſe, you ſhall hear more
of it another time.</p>
               <p>4. At length, ſenſible of his <hi>Impertinency,</hi> he aſks, <hi>What's this to the Miniſter at</hi>
Oſweſtry? Indeed nothing at all, however it helps to fill up Paper for want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Matter.</p>
               <p>But doth he in Earneſt think to reſolve his Queſtion by this following one,
<q>And I alſo aſk, What was it to the Miniſter at <hi>Oſweſtry,</hi> If the Rector of <hi>Bury</hi>
preached a Sermon in Vindication of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi>
Diſſenters?</q> The Sermon he preached and which I anſwered, Charges the
Diſſenters in General with Corrupting the Word of God, eſpecially thoſe in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
in the year 1638. And affirms that the Corruption has been <hi>ſecretly promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
by that Party ever ſince; that it has been publickly own'd by a <hi>Scotch Chamero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian:</hi>
And was all this Charge againſt the <hi>Lancaſhire Diſſenters,</hi> who are not ſo much
as mention'd in the whole Sermon? A Man that dare thus boldly Charge the Body
of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch Presbyterians,</hi> and then think to come off by ſaying, his Sermon
was againſt <hi>the Lancaſhire Diſſenters,</hi> may affirm or deny any thing at his Pleaſure.
It it a bad Omen to ſtumble thus at the Threſhold. Had the Rector preach'd a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
only againſt the <hi>Lancaſhire Diſſenters</hi> (as I hear he has done many) he ſhould
never have heard from the Miniſter at <hi>Oſweſtry.</hi> But when he not only Preaches, but
publiſhes an Invective againſt the whole Body, I judged my ſelf concern'd to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Truth and Innocency. Since he is upon aſking Queſtions, I will take the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doom
to aſk him one, <hi>What is it to the Rector of</hi> Bury, <hi>if I thought fit to Vindicate my
Ordination by Presbyters, whileſt I allow'd the Validity of Epiſcopal Ordination?</hi> I only
juſtified Ordination by Preſbytery, but did not condemn that by Biſhops. This
is the deſign of my Plea for Scripture Ordination, which one wou'd have thought
inoffenſive. But the Rector, like the old <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> confining the Miniſtry, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Salvation, to thoſe of his own Communion, would needs take upon him
to anſwer my Book. This occaſion'd my <hi>Tutamen Evangelicum;</hi> which I had no
ſooner ſent into the Preſs, but his Sermon came to my Hands: When I had read it
over, I was eaſily perſuaded to draw up a few Remarks upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Rector, who is the unhappieſt Man in the World at Conjectures, and
perhaps one of the boldeſt in affirming 'em for Truths, wou'd prove from</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Air in the Remarks from Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s other Writings that he is but the reputed Father
of this ſpurious Off-ſpring: <hi>Who then is the true Father? Why, he believes the</hi> Note-Maker
was principal in the Remarks, and that they are the Work of a Club of Miniſters,
and that the Remarkers true Name is <hi>Legion,</hi> for they are <hi>many.</hi> p. 5.</p>
               <p>If the poor Rector had not been <hi>grievouſly tormented</hi> by the <hi>Remarks,</hi> he had ſcarce
thought of this <hi>frightful Name.</hi> He finds himſelf driven to a <hi>Precipice</hi> with the
<hi>briſtled Herd</hi> in the Goſpel, and wou'd fain keep <hi>above water,</hi> but who can relieve
the <hi>Animal,</hi> whom a <hi>Legion</hi> purſues?</p>
               <p>To be Serious, I thought he had more Senſe than to deny the <hi>Remarks</hi> to be mine,
becauſe they are written in a Stile different from my Writings upon other Subjects.
Any Author that underſtands the Laws of Writing, will adapt his Style to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
he is upon. If my lines are ſomething pointed, the Rector's <hi>infamous detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
by which he had expoſed a vaſt Body of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to an unjuſt and publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
muſt be my Apology. I perceive he is a great Stranger to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
when he affirms my <hi>Remarks</hi> to be <hi>dreſt up with all the gaudy Feathers and Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which the Wit of the Party cou'd furniſh them with.</hi> They were wholly dreſt
up, ſuch as they are, by my ſelf, and the habit they appear in is neither <hi>Sordid</hi> nor
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40622:4"/>
                  <hi>Gay;</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Innocency,</hi> they aſſert, deſires not the former, nor needs the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
A very ſmall degree of Wit will enable a Man to expoſe the Rector's <hi>Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Libel,</hi> which has as little of <hi>Wit</hi> as it has of <hi>Honeſty.</hi> I will not be ſo Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to the Reputation of <hi>his Party</hi> as to ſuſpect any Man of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Candor</hi> among
'em, to have contributed ſo much as a ſingle Stroke to the Criminatory part of his
<hi>Sermon,</hi> which ſo reſembles the true Father, that not only his Figure, but his very
Soul and Spirit are ſquez'd into it. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But the <hi>Remarks,</hi> in their way to <hi>London,</hi> took a tour to <hi>Mancheſter.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>They did ſo, for <hi>Zachary Whitworth</hi> of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> undertook the Printing of 'em.
I preſume the Miniſters might read 'em, but I dare affirm, and ſo will they, that
they neither alter'd them, in whole, or in part, nor added to 'em, except <hi>two lines
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Satisfaction I have made him my Confeſſor for this once, if it may be any relief to
him to know by whom he <hi>ſuffers,</hi> for he ſeems like a Man deſperately wounded,
who turns himſelf every way to behold the Hand that directed the fatal Arrow to
his ſmarting Side.</p>
               <p>Had the <hi>Mancheſter Miniſters</hi> put themſelves to the trouble of anſwering his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
he would have felt more penetrating Strokes; nor is he ſo <hi>formidable</hi> that they
need be afraid; or they ſo <hi>deſpicable,</hi> as to be aſham'd to own their <hi>genuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. He ſtuffs <hi>p.</hi> 6. and 7. with more Invectives againſt the Diſſenters, and indeed
he never ſeems to be ſo much in his Element as when he is upon that Subject. But
at laſt he comes to the <hi>Remarks, p.</hi> 8. and begins with the Preface.</p>
               <p>In my Preface, which conſiſted of four Pages only, I gave a ſhort Account of the
Heads of his Sermon, with brief Remarks upon ſome paſſages in it, which I judg'd
Exceptionable. He has a long Chapter <hi>(Chap. 2.)</hi> which takes up near half his
Book (from <hi>p.</hi> 8. to <hi>p. 32.)</hi> in anſwer to my ſhort Preface. I told him I would not
intermeddle in the Controverſy between him and Mr. <hi>De Laun,</hi> nor will I now: I
I only touch'd upon a few things, concerning which I ſee no Cauſe to alter my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by what he has offer'd, to the Contrary. But I will not detain the Reader
from the main Poin, by attending his tedious digreſſion about the <hi>Titles</hi> of the
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> and the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> which I ſhall conſider in a Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript

Form. p.</hi> 27, 28.</p>
               <p>It's certain the <hi>Fathers</hi> are not free from all the <hi>vulgar Errors</hi> of the Age, in which

is mentioned by ſeveral Fathers. <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> has it, and would prove the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>

               <p>The ingenuous Rector here <q>deſires his Reader to mark, how we are advocating
for the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and <hi>Sadducees,</hi> which in good Time the Diſſenters will compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

(I mean the <hi>Socinians),</hi> and almoſt all the Nation of <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and

               <p>I advocate no further for them than Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> to whoſe <hi>Judgment</hi> the <hi>Rector

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Li. Vol. II. <hi>P.</hi> 1101, 1102.</note> It's the received Opinion amongſt the Learn'd,
that the <hi>Sadducees</hi> refuſed all the old Teſtament but only the <hi>Five Books of Moſes:</hi>
If they mean it abſolutely, I muſt confeſs my ſmall reading hath not taught ſo
far as to be ſatisfied in that: But if they mean it with ſome Qualification, it's
very True. In ſuch a qualified Senſe, as to ſay the reſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> refuſed the

<hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. They admitted not the reading of theſe in the <hi>Synagog,</hi> not
becauſe they undervalued them, but becauſe they counted the reſt Sufficient, <hi>i. e.
the Law and Prophets,</hi> which were read every Sabbath.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> admits not the reading of ſome Parts of the Bible in the

               </p>
               <p>2. But be this Matter as it will, the Rector's inference has as little <hi>Senſe</hi> in it, as
it has <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> If he means, that the <hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi>
are in the Intereſts of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> it is a vile Calumny. If he means that they
are Diſſenters from the <hi>Epiſcopal Churches,</hi> ſo they are from the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> alſo.
Though I muſt tell him, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> in ſome of their printed Pamphlets, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

that Mr. <hi>S. N.</hi> a <hi>beneficed Parſon</hi> of the Church of <hi>E.</hi> is the Author of ſeveral
of the late <hi>Socinian Pamphlets.</hi> I mention not this to reflect on the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
who diſowns this Hereſy, and ought not to be charged with the Errors of
particular Perſons, but as a neceſſary Vindication of our ſelves. I do not know any

As to the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> I know none fitter for their Confederacy than the

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> G. <hi>in his Sermon call'd the Scripture, the</hi> ſupreme Rule of Faith, <hi>to which

               <p>
                  <q>The Rector undertakes to teach us ſeveral <hi>Subordinate Rules of Faith,</hi> ſuch as

               <p>The Induſtrious Rector has found out no leſs than Twelve new <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi>
and theſe may be multiplied into 12000, for every <hi>Article</hi> of a <hi>Creed,</hi> every <hi>Canon</hi>

<hi>Paſſage in a Sermon,</hi> is a <hi>Rule of Faith with the Rector.</hi> For Inſtance, we will
ſuppoſe the Rector a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Man, I hope then you'l receive all his Dictates
for ſo many <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> of which you have abundance in his <hi>Remarks</hi> upon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,</hi>

Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This look's a little Comical, the <hi>ſupreme Rule of Faith is Corrupted,</hi> and you muſt
believe it, becauſe the <hi>ſubordinate Rule,</hi> the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Rector's <hi>Dictates</hi> aſſures
us of it, however it is not Impoſſible but the <hi>ſupreme Rule</hi> may be Right and
Pure, and the <hi>ſubordinate Rule Croked</hi> and <hi>Corrupt.</hi> And the Rector will be ſo <hi>Good</hi>
as to Pardon us, or ſo <hi>Wiſe</hi> as to Inſtruct us better, if we think ſo. I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to underſtand the Reaſon why he is ſo very Impatient of Oppoſition;
why, all his <hi>Dictates are Rules of Faith,</hi> and ought to be received for Oracles:
But the beſt on't is, he allows us the Benefit of another Rule of Faith, that

known <hi>Creeds, Councils, Sermons,</hi> &amp;c. to do ſo; as contrary as they are, they are

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition</hi> he wou'd know no difference between <hi>Plato,
Seneca,</hi> the <hi>wiſe Men</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> (you may if you pleaſe put a wiſe Man of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Would you think it, that a Proteſtant Divine, ſhould talk thus ignorantly of

of the Holy Bible? Can he find ſuch <hi>high Strains</hi> and <hi>noble Flights of Piety</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

Word renewing, quickning, comforting and ſtrengthening his Heart, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Faith into the Authority of God, who ſpeaks powerfully and feelingly unto our

years 1652 and 1659, as appears by the <hi>Worceſter-ſhire</hi> Aſſociation, as alſo by thoſe
of <hi>Cumberland, Weſtmorland, Eſſex,</hi> &amp;c. which are to be ſeen in Print.</p>
               <p>If this Principle did not heal us in thoſe diſtracting and unſettled Times, it does
not follow that it would not do it now in a State of Settlement, and ſuch a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein the Biſhops are in Power, under whom the moderate Diſſenters
wou'd not ſcruple to Exerciſe their Miniſtry, if the offenſive Terms were removed
out of the way.</p>
               <p>And if ever our unhappy Breaches be healed, it muſt be upon this Principle,
which has been aſſerted by the Great Men of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Communion.</p>

that have the Rule over us in all lawful things, <hi>i. e.</hi> which are not forbidden by
God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is, if I underſtand him, that Church Rulers have Power to impoſe
Things lawful, <hi>i. e.</hi> not forbidden, as Terms of Communion, and that it is our
Duty to obey ſuch impoſitions. This Explication permiſed, I anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. He ought to prove, that Chriſt hath Commiſſion'd our Church Rulers to fix
un-ſcriptural Terms of Chriſtian Communion, before he prove it our Duty to obey
'em. Where they have no power to command, I ſee not our obligation to obey.
<q>The grand Commiſſion, ſaith Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> the Apoſtles were ſent out with,
was only <hi>to teach what Chriſt had Commanded them.</hi> Not the leaſt intimation of any
Power given to impoſe or require any thing beyond what himſelf had ſpoken to
them, or they were directed to by the immediate Guidance of the Spirit of God.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Iren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ubi ſupra.</note> It is not whether the things required, be <hi>lawful</hi> or not,—but whether they do

               </p>
               <p>2. He ought to ſhew, that all Things not forbidden may lawfully be impoſed as
Terms of Communion. The uſe of <hi>Oyl, Spittle, Salt, Cream,</hi> &amp;c. are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in Baptiſm, therefore the Rector wou'd ſubmit to the Uſe of them, if his Rulers
think fit to enjoyn them, as is done in Popery. Holy Water is not <hi>forbidden,</hi> nor
are any of the Ceremonies uſed in Popery expreſly <hi>Prohibited</hi> in Scripture,
therefore they are lawful to the Rector. You ſee whither this Hypotheſis tends:
<hi>Sitting</hi> at the Lords Supper is not forbidden, no more is <hi>Proſtration,</hi> the humbleſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of Adoration; the Rector would ſcarce like it, if either of theſe were rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

where we were; that which appears Lawful to the impoſer, may be judged other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

Popiſh Rulers will ſay, it's Lawful to bow to a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> to a <hi>Graven-Image,</hi> to adore
the <hi>Bread</hi> in the Euchariſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let the Rector take which ſide of the Queſtion he

               </p>
               <p>He concludes his Second Chapter, with a Vindication of their reading <hi>Apocrypha</hi>
in the Churches, to the Excluſion of ſeveral Parts of Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Why do the Diſſenters neglect the reading of the Word of God to make way
for their Sermons and Expoſitions?</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>If any do neglect reading the Scriptures, let 'em bear the blame of it, I know
none ſuch. I hope he wou'd not have us lay aſide <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> to fill up
the whole time with reading the holy Scripture. They that <hi>Expound</hi> do alſo <hi>Read,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40622:6"/>
tho' not ſo much, yet perhaps to more Advantage, by helping the People to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what they read. And if preaching (which alſo Explains the holy Scripture)
take up moſt of the time in ſome Congregations, where leſs Scripture is read, it
cannot be denied but preaching is an Ordinance of God, but ſo is not the reading
of <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> and therefore this recrimination is impertinent. But ſaith the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<hi>to read the</hi> Apocrypha <hi>is not to Canonize it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not ſay it is; but to comprehend it under the Name of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi>
as is done in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the <hi>Table</hi> of <hi>Leſſons</hi> in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and to read it to
the total Excluſion of ſome Parts of Scripture, may tempt ignorant People to think
it <hi>Canonical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many wiſe Men, adds he, think the Story of <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Dragon</hi> to be true. <hi>p.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, and they think it <hi>Canonical</hi> too. They are Men <hi>Wiſe</hi> in their
<hi>Generation,</hi> and the Dictates of Wiſe Men are a Rule of Faith to the Rector.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But he is not ſure, but it may be a <hi>Fiction,</hi> or <hi>Fable,</hi> or in more civil Terms a

                  </q> p. 31.</p>
               <p>Names of Perſons, Countries and Places, don't uſe to be inſerted into Parables,
as is done in the Story of <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Dragon,</hi> as alſo in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidiouſly
compares to this <hi>fabulous Story.</hi> The Book of <hi>Job</hi> is allow'd to be <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
by all Chriſtians, and has all the Characters of a real Hiſtory, the Names of
<hi>Places, Perſons,</hi> &amp;c. his Children, Eſtate, Loſſes, Friends, Enemies and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
are particularly deſcribed, and he is expreſly mention'd by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in
other Places, <hi>Ez. 14. 14. James</hi> 5. 11. and cited in <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 3. 19. I find in <hi>Pools
Synopſis</hi> but two Sorts of People that make the Hiſtory of <hi>Job</hi> a <hi>Parable,</hi> ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Jews</hi> and ſome Modern <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> but neither one nor 'tother at preſent
ſeem to own that Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Rector is a rare Man, he can convert an <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Fable into a <hi>Divine Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi>
and a <hi>Divine Hiſtory</hi> into a <hi>Parabolical Fable.</hi> And that you may not think
him ſingular in this Faculty, he has <hi>Papiſts, Jews</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in his Intereſts.</p>
               <p>He that denies the Book of <hi>Job</hi> to be a Hiſtory, may in good Time, turn all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Hiſtory into a Parable, or a <hi>cunninly deviſed Fable,</hi> and when he has ſerv'd a

               <head type="sub">Being an Anſwer to his Third Chapter.</head>
               <p>IN his Third Chapter, he pretends to Anſwer my firſt, in which I obſerved
<hi>(p. 1.) That in a Sermon to the Clergy, a Teſtimony againſt the ſhameful Scandals of
ſome of them, wou'd have became a faithful Miniſter,</hi> but that he had other work to
do, his Buſineſs being to <hi>accuſe</hi> of ſecret Crimes, and not to reprove for <hi>open</hi> Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the Rector can ſay for this</hi> inexcuſable Omiſſion <hi>and Partiality is,</hi> That he dare
<hi>undertake</hi> to point out as many Scandalous Diſſenting Miniſters in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> as we can
Clergy Men. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>He is a Man of <hi>bold <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking,</hi> but the one and the other are pretty well
known in that Country and other Parts of the Nation, which will ſcarce receive
the Dictates of this <hi>daring <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker</hi> againſt the Evidence of Senſe and common
Obſervation. If he knows any <hi>Scandalous Diſſenting Miniſters,</hi> let him name the
Men, and ſpare not.</p>
               <p>I added <hi>p.</hi> 2, 3, 4. that the Corruption in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. is inconſiſtent with the
Principles of the Preſbyterians; that I never knew any that approv'd of that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
that his Charge amounts to no more than a bare Suſpition that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
have ſecretly contributed to the Corruption of this Place; that had not he
Examin'd the Errata of the Preſs more out of ill Will to the Diſſenters, than good
Will to the Publick, he might have found ſeveral other Errors of the Preſs as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
as <hi>ye</hi> for <hi>we;</hi> as <hi>ſhe</hi> for <hi>he,</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. in a Twelves Bible, <hi>London 1691.
we</hi> for <hi>ye</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 6. 21. in a Quarto Edition of the Bible at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> 1675. and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
more I mention there.</p>
               <p>Among all theſe Particulars, he takes notice only of the laſt, and to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
moſt falſly Affirms, <hi>That all I offer in this Chapter, in Vindication of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
is, that ſeveral Editions of the Bible abound with ſuch Errors as are deſtructive
of the Senſe.</hi> Judge by this what Credit is to be given to the Rectors Affirmations,
But let's hear what he can ſay to the Errors of the Preſs, of which I give a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.
He has four Things to offer, <hi>p.</hi> 32, 33.</p>
               <p>I. He quarrels with an Uncorrected Error of the Preſs (in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>).
And diſingenouſly inſinuates as if I were defective in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
is grievouſly at a loſs how to make good his Charge, ſince he fills Paper with
ſuch ſtuff as this.</p>
               <p>II. Tho' he might be juſtly ſuſpected (ſaith the Rector), in the Account given
of theſe <hi>Errata</hi>'s, yet I will admit it to be True. A mighty Favour indeed! To
admit that for True which he cannot diſprove; but his moſt generous Conceſſions
have a Tincture of his ill Nature, which is as <hi>Lazy</hi> as it is <hi>Suſpicious.</hi> I refer to the
Editions, why is he not at the Pains to Examin them, if he juſtly ſuſpects my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
The Truth is, it is not as Eaſie to <hi>diſprove,</hi> as to <hi>impeach</hi> ones Veracity. The
Rector has an excellent Faculty at the latter, let who will undertake the former.</p>
               <p>III. <q>Such Errors don't eſtabliſh any Untruth, nor favour any ſide in the preſent
Controverſies, nor has Mr. <hi>O.</hi> given us one Example of the ſame Error repeated
in ſeveral Editions.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>Where they make a corrupt Senſe, they eſtabliſh an Untruth, as in <hi>Job 6. 21.
we are nothing,</hi> it ſhould be, <hi>ye are nothing.</hi> There is <hi>we</hi> for <hi>ye,</hi> as in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40622:7"/>
you have <hi>ye</hi> for <hi>we.</hi> So that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>ye</hi> are eaſily miſtaken one for another. But
the Rector ſeems to have no concern for any Truth, but what reſpects the Biſhops
power. Avoid all Corruption that may prejudice that, and this <hi>tender hoofed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
(it is his own Expreſſion, <hi>p. 24.)</hi> can eaſily digeſt all the reſt. It was none
of my buſineſs to Examin, how often theſe Errors have been repeated, tho' I told
him, Remark <hi>p. 13. an Error in one Impreſſion is eaſily repeated, becauſe the Frames
of the Bible are often kept intire, and not broken by half Sheets, as in printing other Books,
and ſo the ſame ſet of Frames ſerves for a ſecond and third Impreſſion, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
until the Letters decay and grow uſeleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this He takes no Notice of.</p>
               <p>IV. <q>An Error of the Preſs deſerves not to be taken to taſk, when no ill Uſe is
made of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I know no Body that has made any ill Uſe of <hi>ye</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. Nor has he yet
been able to produce any one Writer among the Diſſenters, that has made Uſe of
it againſt the Biſhops. His <hi>Cameronian</hi> Story we ſhall Examin anon.</p>
               <p>Does he know what ill Uſe may be made by ignorant People of other Errors of
the Preſs?</p>
               <p>I took notice in my Remarks, of his looſe and careleſs way of citing Scriptures,
and gave <hi>Ten Inſtances</hi> of it in that very Sermon, in which he Charges the Diſſenters
with a <hi>literal</hi> Error of the Preſs, which he can't prove upon them. One might
have expected more Exactneſs from ſo Critical a <hi>Cenſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he Anſwers, <q>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> did not tie themſelves to the
very Words of the Scripture in their Quotations, <hi>p.</hi> 34, 35. nor does Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> were <hi>infallibly</hi> acted by the Holy Ghoſt in their Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and had Reaſons for their Variation: The Rector is not only deſtitute of a
Spirit of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but of ſuch Reaſons as may Juſtify his chopping and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Texts of Scripture at his Pleaſure. He does not pretend to give any Reaſon
why he ſhould miſ-quote ſo many Scriptures within the compaſs of one ſhort Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
nor is the thing Capable of any other but this, that the Rector is a very
careleſs Tranſcriber of the Scripture</p>
               <p>I believe he cannot produce in Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or ſcarſe in any other Author ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Texts of Scripture miſ-quoted in one Sermon as there are in his: Much leſs
can he give an Inſtance of ſo Supine a Negligence in Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as to miſ-render
the Text of his Sermon. This the Rector has done, ſubſtituting the ſingular (Word)
<hi>add thou not unto his Word,</hi> for the plural (Words) add thou not unto his <hi>Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I acquitted him from</hi> Corrupting the Senſe, <hi>in this Variation, but gave this neceſſary
Caution,</hi> allow Men a liberty of a literal Variation from the Language of the Holy Ghoſt,
the Senſe and meaning can't be long ſecured. This he calls a putid and ridiculous Remark.</p>
               <p>The Rector<hi>'s ye</hi> and <hi>we</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. confirms my Remark; the Variation is in one
Letter, but the Senſe and Meaning is deſtroy'd by it. Suppoſe a bold Tranſcriber
ſhould write <hi>Gods</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> this is a <hi>literal Variation,</hi> but ſuch as deſtroys the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity

               <p>IN this Chapter the Rector endavours to confirm his Arguments <hi>to prove the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

happen'd in 1638. when Preſbytery was in the Aſcendant. <hi>2ly.</hi> It favours the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.
<hi>3ly.</hi> The Epiſcopal Party deſign'd not to Corrupt this Place. <hi>4ly.</hi> A <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronian</hi>
urged this Corrupt reading.</p>
               <p>To his <hi>firſt</hi> Argument, that the Corruption happen'd in 38. when Preſbytery
was in the Aſcendant, I anſwered Three Things, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>two Events may happen
at the ſame time, that have no relation to one another.</hi> 
                  <q>Right, ſaith he, when there
is nothing elſe to be alledged for confirming the Suſpicion, but the Turbulency of
the Times, the Sway of the Populacy, and the Corruption of this Place: All
looked the ſame way, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Extripation of Epiſcopacy.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>The Times were not Turbulent at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he ſaith the firſt Corruption
happen'd, nor was there any <hi>Sway of Populacy there</hi> in the Year 38. <hi>Buck</hi> and <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
the Univerſity Printers at that time, were both Epiſcopal Men, as I obſerv'd in
my Remarks, but this he takes no Notice of; is it likely that the <hi>Cambridge Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Printers,</hi> ſhould conſpire with the <hi>Scotch Covenanters</hi> to root out <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in
that Year?</p>
               <p>I never underſtood before, that an Error of the Preſs had an influence for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of Epiſcopacy. The Rector has not produc'd any one Inſtance of any <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>

               <p>Be it ſo, all that can be infer'd from it is, that I miſtook his Meaning, which a Man
may eaſily do in a Writer, whoſe Notions are confuſed and incoherent, and way of

                  <hi>True</hi> ſaith he, yet unto the two firſt I added, <hi>I am willing to believe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Remarks were juſt now with him all of a <hi>Third, Lies and Stories,</hi> and yet in
the ſame Breath, he cannot but acknowledge my Quotations to be <hi>True. If</hi> they <hi>are
all Lies and Stories,</hi> there is no Truth in them, but ſome Things are <hi>True,</hi> by his own
Confeſſion; therefore he is inexcuſable, for wherein he Judgeth another, he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
himſelf. As <hi>Diogenes</hi> trampled upon <hi>Plato</hi>'s Pride with a greater Pride, ſo
the Rector exhibits a <hi>lying Accuſation</hi> againſt my Remarks, that they are all <hi>Lies and
Stories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he qualified ſome of his other Conceſſions, by ſaying, he was willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<hi>that the firſt Corruption was an unfortunate Over-ſight</hi> and a <hi>meer Error of Preſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he is <hi>willing to believe</hi> this himſelf, what a diſingenuous Thing is it in him to
endeavour to perſuade others to the <hi>Contrary?</hi> The deſign of his Argument is to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40622:8"/>
make People believe the firſt Corruption in 38. was a deſigned Thing to root out
Epiſcopacy. Is this the Part of an <hi>honeſt Man</hi> Mr. Rector, to perſuade the World
to believe what's contrary to your own Belief? I hope all your Sermons are not of a
Piece with this, you muſt not blame us for believing as you do, that the Error you
Charge us with was an <hi>unfortunate Over-ſight</hi> and a <hi>meer Error of the Preſs,</hi> and then
your Argument is out of Doors: Eſpecially, when you poſitively Affirm, that it was
an <hi>accidental Slip,</hi> an <hi>unhappy Miſtake.</hi> Thus his firſt and chief Argument is eternally
diſmiſſed by himſelf, and his Attempts to defend it, do but ſhew the Rector to be as
<hi>Ill</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> as he is a <hi>Diſputant.</hi> To be willing to believe us Innocent, and at the
ſame time to endeavour to prove us Guilty, be-ſpeaks a Diſpoſition worſe than that
of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who tho' he condemn'd <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when he had pronounced him <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
did not ſeek for Evidence to prove him <hi>Guilty,</hi> he contented himſelf to give an
<hi>unjuſt Sentence</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>Jews:</hi> But the Rector did not ſeem to be under the
temptation of pleaſing his own Party, who were ſo far from extorting this unjuſt
Sentence from him, that ſeveral of them have condemn'd him for it; yet he has not
only paſſed an unrighteous Judgment upon us, but has done his utmoſt to load us
with an <hi>unproved Guilt,</hi> after he had made our Crime, an <hi>accidental Slip,</hi> and <hi>unhappy
Miſtake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I prov'd, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that Preſbytery was not in the Aſcendant in <hi>England</hi> in
38. That conformity was then at the higheſt, being urged by <hi>Arch Biſhop Laud</hi> and
his Faction with great Severity, that many were ſuſpended, deprived and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
for not reading the <hi>Book of Sports,</hi> in 37.</p>
               <p>I gave an Account of about Thirty Miniſters ſo uſed in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Norwich.</hi>
And in 38. many more were Suſpended for not uſing <hi>Hoods and Surplices,</hi> many were
driven to foreign Countries, to <hi>Holland, New-England,</hi> &amp;c. whither the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
deſign'd to purſue 'em, and to <hi>Dragoon</hi> 'em into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conformity: I
prov'd they were deprived not only of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> but of the <hi>Preſs</hi> alſo by a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi>
paſſed in the <hi>Star Chamber, July the</hi> 1ſt, 1637. By Virtue of this Decree, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Geneva</hi> Bibles with Notes were ſeized in <hi>Holland,</hi> and a New Impreſſion deſign'd
for <hi>England,</hi> was ſtop'd from coming over. All this I prov'd out of <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> and
<hi>Heylyn,</hi> by which it appears what little Credit is to be given to his ſecret Hiſtory
of the Preſbyterians Corrupting the Word of God in Thirty Eight, when he ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
Contradicts the <hi>Publick Hiſtory</hi> of that Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this the Rector Anſwers,</hi> He wou'd not for any Thing be found tripping in this Part
of his Argument. <hi>p,</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>That Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> blunders about the ſignification of theſe Words, <hi>being in the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi>
which he underſtands of being in full Power and Authority, as if it were the
ſame with having the Aſcendant: And <hi>leaſt you ſhould think him</hi> an <hi>Ignoramus in the
Mathematicks,</hi> be informs us out of <hi>Lyburn,</hi> when a Star is ſaid to be <hi>in the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi>
which is, when having paſſed the <hi>Imum Caeli,</hi> and being got into the the Aſcendant,
it bends it's courſe towards <hi>Medium Caeli</hi> and the Meridian, <hi>i. e.</hi> is Aſcending.</p>
               <p>I hope you are Edified by this Piece of Learning: <hi>A Star is in the Aſcendant,</hi> when
it is got into the <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> and is <hi>Aſcending:</hi> This puts me in Mind of that famous
Verſe of <hi>Battus</hi> the Poet,
<q>Montibus, inquit, erant, &amp; erant in montibus illis;</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which you may thus <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in conformity to the Rector:
<q>
                     <l>The Mountains high he did Aſcend,</l>
                     <l>Aſcending ſtill, he did Aſcend.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40622:9"/>
His Explications are <hi>tranſcendent Blunders,</hi> which wou'd have been more Excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if he had not ſet up for a <hi>Teacher</hi> of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and involv'd a learned
Author in a <hi>tautological Pleonaſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rectors diſtinction between <hi>being in the Aſcedant, and having the Aſcendant</hi>
is a little Nice, he owns Preſbytery had not the Aſcendant in Thirty Eight, and yet
Affirms it <hi>was got into the Aſcendant.</hi> But the happineſs is, this Diſtinction will do
him no good, for my Argument proves Preſbytery to be ſo far from the <hi>Aſcendant</hi>
in his very Senſe, that it makes it to be in the <hi>Deſcendant</hi> in <hi>England</hi> that Year.
Epiſcopacy was never higher, nor Preſbytery lower. The Epiſcopal Power was in
its <hi>Meridian Altitude,</hi> having the <hi>High Commiſſion-Court</hi> and the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it, and an Active <hi>Arch-Prelate</hi> moving in the <hi>higheſt Orb,</hi> whoſe Influences were
as <hi>Malignant</hi> to the <hi>Puritans</hi> (the better Part of the Church of England then) as
they were <hi>favourable</hi> to the Men of <hi>Ceremony.</hi> In a Word, he had the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
(if any ſuch there were) under his Feet, and made this <hi>Climate</hi> too hot
for them, that they were glad to ſeek for ſhelter in the remoteſt Parts of the Earth.
This I have prov'd out of <hi>Heylyn,</hi> but the Rector wiſely overlooks it. If being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Foot and trampled in the duſt be <hi>Aſcending</hi> towards the <hi>Meridian,</hi> then were
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the <hi>Aſcendant</hi> in Thirty Eight. If bending their Courſe <hi>verſus
fines terrae,</hi> be the ſame with bending it <hi>verſus medium Caeli,</hi> they muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to be in the <hi>Aſcendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſaith he,</hi> That prodigious and terrible <hi>blazing Star,</hi> the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that very Year
<hi>begun</hi> to appear in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſoon drew the Eyes and Inclinations of a great
Part of <hi>England</hi> upon it. <hi>p.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>The Covenant appear'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> long before Thirty Eight, and was ſubſcribed
by King <hi>James</hi> I. as I ſhew'd in my Remarks. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>The renewing of the Covenant in Thirty Eight, proves Preſbytery to be in the
<hi>Aſcendant</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but what is this to <hi>England?</hi> Preſbytery is now in the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I hope the Rector will not ſay it is ſo in <hi>England.</hi> It muſt be ſo by
his Argument, He undertook to prove Preſbytery in the <hi>Aſcendant</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> It muſt be ſo by
his Argument, He undertook to prove Preſbytery in the <hi>Aſcedant</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and
his Argument is, it was ſo in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if the State of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were
always the ſame. Lets ſee the Strength of this <hi>doughty</hi> Argument, the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Covenant</hi> appear'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> in Thirty Eight, therefore the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> at
<hi>Cambridge</hi> corrupted the Bible. Did the <hi>Scotch Covenant</hi> depend upon altering of
<hi>we</hi> into <hi>ye</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> or did the Alteration depend on the <hi>Covenant?</hi> Was there
a Conſpiracy between the <hi>Scotch Covenanters,</hi> and the <hi>Cambridge Epiſcopal Printers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe the <hi>Covenant</hi> drew the Inclinations of ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> this does not prove
<hi>Presbytery</hi> in the <hi>Aſcendant</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> much leſs does it prove the Preſbyterians
Guilty of Corrupting the Word of God. A Man may have Inclinations to <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
and not be a Corrupter of the Word of God—</p>
               <p>Thus the Rector <hi>who wou'd not for any Thing be found tripping in this Part of his
Argument,</hi> is found not only to Trip, but to Stumble and overthrow his Rider,
when he affirms Preſbytery to be in the Aſcendant in Thirty Eight, in <hi>England.</hi>
But ſuppoſe <hi>Presbytery</hi> had been <hi>in the Aſcendant</hi> then, this will not prove the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
Authors of that Corruption; <hi>1ſt.</hi> It does not favour their Principles.
<hi>2ly.</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> had guarded the Preſs againſt them, as I have prov'd, nor
was the Rector able to Contradict me. <hi>3ly.</hi> the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Printers in Thirty
Eight, were <hi>Epiſcopal Men,</hi> who ought in Juſtice to be charged with the Errors of the
Preſs. <hi>4ly.</hi> The Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was far from being Preſbyterian at that
time, the Heads of Colledges being all Epiſcopal, a Liſt of which Mr. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Talents</hi> communicated to me, which I find agreeing with Mr. <hi>Fullers</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Church Hiſtory.</note>. To this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40622:9"/>
the Rector Anſwers, <q>That Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> talks like one who knows not <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                  </q>
Nor had diligence enough to inform himſelf, and Mr. <hi>Talents,</hi> he fears is paſt his
<hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> not to ſay his <hi>Integrity. p.</hi> 37. 39.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> has known <hi>Cambridge</hi> above twenty Years ago when he was admitted
Student there, Mr. <hi>Talents</hi> Judgment, Memory and Integrity deſerves not to be
reflected on, ſince Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> fully
writes the ſame thing he mention'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſaith he,</hi> beſides theſe ſixteen Heads, there are Fellows, Scholars, Noble-men a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Commoners,
Perſioners and Siſars or Servitors, which make up about 2000, among
which there were many that favour'd <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Emanuel,</hi> which not long
after furniſhed ſix Colledges with Heads, and it was call'd <hi>pure Emanuel;</hi> from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <hi>Puritans</hi> in it. <hi>p.</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>The Rector informs us of what every body knows, that there are a great many
Students in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and if he can find there five or ſix <hi>Presbyterians</hi> among two
Thouſand Scholars, he thinks he has prov'd his Charge againſt that Party of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the Word of God. This puts me in Mind of a Paſſage in <hi>Lactamius,</hi> He
ſaith, that as <hi>Diocletian</hi> was Sacrificing, and the <hi>ordinary Marks</hi> in the <hi>Intrailes</hi> of the
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> not appearing, Tages, <hi>that were ſet over the</hi> Diviners, <hi>ſaid, that their Rites
did not ſucceed, becauſe there were ſome prophane Perſons</hi> (i. e. <hi>Chriſtians) that had
thruſt themſelves into the Aſſembly.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Lactant of the Prim. Perſ. Ergl. by Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi> p. 75.</note> This occaſion'd the laſt and great Perſecution
of the Chriſtians under that Emperour and his Collegues. The Rector is as juſt
to the <hi>Furitans,</hi> as the <hi>Pagan Prieſts</hi> were to the Ancient <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> their being <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſpot</hi> is ſufficient to make the one and the other Criminals. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was Accuſed for bringing <hi>Greeks</hi> into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the Evidence was, they had
ſeen <hi>Trophimus</hi> with him in the City. <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>I have heard of a certain late Judge, that as he paſſed a dirty Place in <hi>London</hi>-Streets,
he found a Man ſheltring himſelf under a Belcony from a Shower of Rain.
Sir, ſaith he, to the Man <hi>I will have you indited for this Nuſance.</hi> The Man told him,
he was a Stranger there, that's nothing, replies the Judg, <hi>I have found you on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes,</hi>
and you muſt Anſwer for the <hi>Nuſance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rector thinks he has found a few <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in Thirty Eight,
among near two Thouſand Church-men, and they muſt be Guilty of the <hi>Corruptive
Nuſance,</hi> becauſe he has <hi>found 'em on the Premiſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which ſpoiles all is, the <hi>Puritans</hi> were Members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and generally of the <hi>Epiſcopal Judgment,</hi> nay the Moderate and Pious <hi>Biſhops</hi>
cou'd not eſcape that <hi>Nick-name,</hi> which was applied to all <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in Doctrine, as
Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> confeſſeth.<note n="†" place="bottom">Life of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud.</hi> p. 124.</note> Tho' in ſtrictneſs the Name was given to the <hi>Non-con-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi>
which were very few at that time, the Terms of Conformity not being ſcrew'd
up to the preſent height.</p>
               <p>But the Heads of Colledgs were no <hi>Puritans,</hi> no not Dr. <hi>Haldſworth</hi> Maſter of <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
who was put out by the Parliament; and any Man will judge of the State of
the Univerſity, and indeed of all Societies, by the <hi>Governing Party,</hi> who have a
conſiderable Influence in their reſpective Provinces. If <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſupplied <hi>Trinity
Colledge, Oxford,</hi> with ten Fellows that were for the Parliament (as he affirms <hi>p. 39.)</hi>
It does not follow they were <hi>Presbyterians</hi> before, for we know its uſual for abundance
of People to change with the Times; I doubt not but the Rector can Name the Men
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40622:10"/>
who took the <hi>Covenant</hi> and the <hi>Engagement;</hi> and after all, approv'd themſelves to be
right <hi>Epiſcopal</hi>-Men. Beſides, many of thoſe that were made Fellows at <hi>Oxford</hi> in
the Year 1638. were very Young, and not admitted in <hi>Cambridge</hi> till after 1648.</p>
               <p>From the whole it appears that Preſbytery in Thirty Eight, was not in the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Cambridge</hi> where all the Heads of Colledges were
<hi>Epiſcopal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have expos'd the weak Vindication of his Firſt Argument from the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance</hi>
of <hi>Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I affirm'd the <hi>Scotch Covenant</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be
more Ancient than Thirty Eight, which the Rector cannot deny, but he endeavours
to prove from the <hi>Fundamental Charter of Presbyter examin'd,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in</hi> Scotland <hi>was firſt caſt into the Epiſcopal Platform, and continued ſo for fifteen
Years. p.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>The Pamphlet to which he refers, has been learnedly anſwer'd by Dr. <hi>Rule</hi> in his
<hi>good old Way defended,</hi> to which I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>The Reformation there was gradually, and with much oppoſition carried on, as
it was here in <hi>England,</hi> and no wonder, if in ſuch a ſtruggle <hi>Eſau</hi> came forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Jacob,</hi> but certain it is, when they came to ſome degree of Settlement. Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
was ſet up, and the <hi>confeſſion of Faith,</hi> in which they promiſed to ad-here
to that Government, was ſign'd by King <hi>James</hi> the I. and his Houſhold, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580.
and by Perſons of all Ranks <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. by Ordinance of the Council, and Acts of
the <hi>General Aſſembly.</hi> It was ſubſcribed again by all Perſons, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1590.
with a <hi>General Band</hi> for maintenance of the true Religion and the Kings Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I am ſtill of Opinion (ſaith he), That the <hi>Scotch Kirk</hi> put away the Wife of
its Youth, I mean Epiſcopacy, when it reform'd from Popery, and joyn'd it ſelf
unto an Harlot (I mean <hi>Presbytery).</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I think <hi>Presbytery</hi> as <hi>Honeſt</hi> as <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and I am ſure the Church loſt it's puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and degenerated into a <hi>Harlot,</hi> under the Lordly and Tyranical Government of
<hi>Popiſh Biſhops. p.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>What an honourable Character does this Gentleman give to the Reformation, in
which not only <hi>Scotland,</hi> but moſt of the forreign Proteſtant Churches are concern'd?
When they caſt off <hi>Idolatrous Popiſh Biſhops,</hi> they put away the Wife of their Youth;
when they put themſelves under the Conduct of <hi>Proteſtant Paſtors,</hi> they joyn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to a <hi>Harlot.</hi> In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they lived in chaſt Wedlock under Popery, and
<hi>defiled</hi> the Marriage-bed, when they became Proteſtants. This looks more like the
Language of a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> than of a Proteſtant-Miniſter.</p>
               <p>The Rector, in his Sermon baſely reflected upon the ACT of Settling <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in Scotland</hi> (tho' touched by the <hi>Royal Scepter),</hi> and alſo upon his Majeſties
Words in his Letter of Inſtructions to his <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> both which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
Preſbytery <hi>most agreeable to the Inclination of the</hi> Scotch <hi>Nation,</hi> which is ſuch
another Reaſon (faith he) as an <hi>Adultrer</hi> might give for his <hi>Wantomeſs.</hi> He
would fain Palliate this <hi>inexcuſable Indecency</hi> towards the King (which I complain'd
of) tho' he comes off but ſorrily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> 
                  <q>This is the firſt time (ſaith he), I ever heard of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> having any
due regard unto a Kings Honour, and perhaps it will be the laſt, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
Principle gets a little more footing among us.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have approv'd themſelves to be as Good Subjects as any of their
Neighbours, both in this and neighbouring Countries; for the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
let him aſk the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> and the perſecuted <hi>Vaudois:</hi> For <hi>this,</hi> let him
conſult their <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> which aſſert Obedience and Subjection to the Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
I have known ſeveral <hi>Presbyterians</hi> who had that regard to a <hi>Kings Honour,</hi> as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40622:10"/>
to quit all their Preferments rather then take the <hi>Engagement,</hi> to exclude the King
when many <hi>Epiſcopal Men</hi> ſubmitted to it. It's true, they generally took Part with
the <hi>Parliament</hi> in our unhappy Civil Wars, and ſo did abundance of Church-Men:
But <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> in 1688. have eminently juſtified <hi>Forty One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Republican Principle gets footing, its amongſt ſome of his <hi>Jacobite Brethren,</hi>
who under Colour of that Principle wou'd promote the Intereſt of their Old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
I know not any one Preſbyterian who is for a <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> I confeſs, they
are not for making Princes Abſolute, as the Rector is, who declares that the <hi>King's</hi>
Coronation Oath <hi>is a voluntary Act of Grace, unto which the King is not obliged by
the Fundamental Conſtitution, and that the Prince, in Effect, is the</hi> ſole ſovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

                  <head type="sub">His 2d. Argument to prove the Diſſenters Guilty of Corrupting the Word of God,
is this, The Corruption in appearance favours the Diſſenters, and their Deſign,
againſt Epiſcopacy.</head>
                  <p>TO this <hi>Argument</hi> I anſwer'd three Things,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> He durſt not ſay, the Corruption <hi>favours</hi> the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> for he knows
the Contrary: But he ſlily ſays it does in appearance favour them; this <hi>appearance</hi>
is only to himſelf, for I believe no <hi>Diſſenter</hi> ever thought of it. This he takes no
notice of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40622:11"/>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> I told him that I knew no Principle of any ſober Diſſenters, that is favoured
by this Corruption. I refer'd him to the <hi>Directory</hi> for <hi>Ordination,</hi> and the <hi>Heads</hi> of
<hi>Agreement</hi> between the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Congregational Men</hi> in (1691.) in both
which the Power of Ordination is lodged in the Miniſters, and not in the People, to
whom they aſcribe only the Power of Chuſing them, according to this very Text
<hi>(Acts 6. 3.)</hi> and the Rector's concurrent Teſtimony, if that were of any Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<note n="*" place="bottom">Tent. Novum. p. 4.</note>.</p>
                  <p>He allows the People as much Power in making their Miniſter as the Diſſenters
do, and therefore by this Argument, muſt either acquit them, or condemn
himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Here the <hi>Water ſticks</hi> to the Rector, he knows not which way to turn him about,
rather than retract his malicious Calumny, like a Man hardoned in Sin, he'l make
uſe of any ſorry ſhift to <hi>Paliate his Guilt,</hi> and Expoſe the Innocent.</p>
                  <p>He cannot deny this to be the Judgment of the Diſſenters, that <hi>Ordination</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and Election ordinarily to the <hi>People.</hi> But ſaith he, <q>among
us the Biſhop <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> and <hi>Appoints</hi> by an Act altogether diſtinct from <hi>Ordination,</hi>
as we <hi>believe</hi> was the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Caſe of the <hi>Deacons:</hi> But among the Diſſenters the Paſtors
Ordain, and the People chuſe and appoint 'em.</q> 
                     <hi>p.</hi> 43.</p>
                  <p>He may <hi>believe</hi> what he pleaſes, but the Text mentions no other Appointment of
the Apoſtles, but what was by <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Impoſition</hi> of <hi>Hands, Acts</hi> 6. 3, 6. which
he cannot deny to be meant of <hi>Ordination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He diſingenuouſly miſ-repreſents us, when he ſays the People <hi>Chuſe</hi> and <hi>Appoint,</hi>
they <hi>Chuſe</hi> indeed, but the Miniſters <hi>Appoint</hi> or <hi>Ordain</hi> 'em to the <hi>Office,</hi> which they
very rarely or never do <hi>Sine Titulo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I noted, that the Diſſenters cou'd be under no Temptation to Corrupt this Place,
the Peoples power of chuſing their Miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being aſſerted in this very Text,
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. Look ye out <hi>among</hi> you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>v. 5. they choſe Stephen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this he ridiculouſly replies, <q>they choſe not the Perſons immediately into the
Office deſign'd them.</q> 
                     <hi>p.</hi> 44.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> never aſſerted ſuch an <hi>Election,</hi> which he cannot but know,
though he thinks fit to abuſe them. The Peoples choice does not appoint or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
'em in their Office, nor oblige the Miniſters to ordain 'em, if they judge them
not duly qualified.—</p>
                  <p>As to his granting the Peoples power of chuſing their Miniſters, he ſays, <q>he
is of the ſame Opinion ſtill, being under no <hi>neceſſity</hi> to alter it, that he is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not what changes in Opinion, his <hi>Neceſſities</hi> may oblige him to, but if
his Argument or any other <hi>Neceſſity</hi> require it, it ſeems he can <hi>change</hi> as there is
Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>It is certain at preſent he allows the People as much Power in chuſing their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
as we do: And therefore this Corruption does no more favour us, than it
does the Rector, who muſt either honeſtly acquit us or condemn himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly.</hi> I obſerv'd farther, that the Diſſenters look on the VII. Deacons, as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at Tables, and not of the Word. For proof of this I refer'd him to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,</hi>
and infer'd that it is not likely they ſhou'd Corrupt a Text to aſſert the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
power</hi> in making <hi>Goſpel Miniſters,</hi> which in <hi>their Opinion</hi> ſpeaks not of thoſe that
<hi>Miniſter</hi> in Goſpel <hi>Myſteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Rector anſwers, <q>I can't help theſe Men's <hi>Judgments</hi> if they do not; or will
not ſee it, 'tis becauſe <hi>there is no light in them.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>p.</hi> 45.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I help this Mans <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> who ſhuts his Eyes againſt the <hi>Light,</hi> for the
queſtion is not here, whether the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> be in the Right, as to their Opinion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40622:11"/>
of <hi>Deacons,</hi> but whether or no they take 'em as <hi>Miniſters of Tables</hi> and not of the
Word?</p>
                  <p>This I prov'd and he cannot deny it: Now if this be their Notion of <hi>Deacons,</hi>
my Inference holds good, <hi>they wou'd not Corrupt a Text</hi> to aſſert the Peoples power,
in making Goſpel Miniſters <hi>which in their Opinion ſpeaks not of thoſe that Miniſter in
Goſpel Myſteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Argument is, the Corruption favours the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> I anſwer in the Negative,
for which I give this Reaſon, this Text ſpeaks not of <hi>Miniſters of the Word</hi> in their
Opinion, and therefore they wou'd not Corrupt it to aſſert the Peoples power in
making <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Here he aſks us an impertinent Queſtion, why do we not <hi>Ordian</hi>
our <hi>Deacons,</hi> or <hi>Overſeeres</hi> of the Poor as the Apoſtles did? <hi>p.</hi> 45.</p>
                  <p>We ſet them not apart by impoſition of Hands, for the ſame Reaſon that the
Church of England Ordains them not. None will ſay, that we are neceſſarily obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to uſe <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> in all caſes wherein we find it uſed in Scripture. Tho'
we condemn not thoſe that <hi>Ordain</hi> their <hi>Deacons,</hi> as ſome Diſſenters do.</p>
                  <p>I have now diſmiſs'd his <hi>2d.</hi> Argument, and made it appear that the <hi>Corruption</hi>
charged upon us does not only not favour any <hi>Principles</hi> of ours, but is inconſiſtent
with 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Before I proceed to his</hi> 3d. <hi>Argument, I muſt take notice of a baſe Suggeſtion,</hi>
as if I had not obtain'd my former Poſte at <hi>Wr.</hi> by fair and honeſt Means, but had betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by a paultrey Trick ſupplanted Mr. <hi>B.</hi> my Predeceſſor, and ſtept into his Place,
and diſcovered the Secrets of my inward Friend and Confident, who diſcloſed his Heart
to me as to a Confeſſor. <hi>p.</hi> 45.</p>
                  <p>I was ſo far from ſupplanting and betraying Mr. <hi>B.</hi> at <hi>Wr.</hi> that I knew nothing
of the Difference between him and the Congregation, which occaſion'd his <hi>Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
them, until Mr. <hi>Tong</hi> (now of <hi>Coventry)</hi> was actually choſen by them, and
rended with them, I being then in <hi>London.</hi> And my Poſte there has been and is hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
Charitably to ſupply 'em, and that moſtly to my Charge, until they be ſettl'd
under a Miniſter of their own.</p>
                  <p>I have often recommended Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to them, but for ſome Reaſons I find 'em not
willing to be farther concern'd with him.</p>
                  <p>I know of no Secrets he ever Committed to me, and I challenge him or any other
Perſon to mention any Secrets I ever Divulged to his Prejudice. I always reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
him for his true Worth, but we never had any great Intimacy or inward Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
to make me either his <hi>Confident</hi> or <hi>Confeſſor.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">His 3d. Argument is this, It cannot be that the Epiſcopal Party deſign'd to Corrupt this
Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that would be to deſtroy, what their Church Government ſeems to be built on.</head>
                  <p>I Anſwer'd, this proves nothing againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> nor did they charge the
<hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> with any deſign of Corrupting it, tho' the Preſs was in their
Hands, and ſtrictly guarded againſt the <hi>Puritans</hi> in the Year. 1638.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Rector according to his wonted Ingennity replies,</hi> if it were deſignedly done,
or afterwards propagated with deſign, then becauſe Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> acquitted us, the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
muſt confeſs Guilty. <hi>p.</hi> 46.</p>
                  <p>Is this Candid, becauſe we charitably acquit the Epiſcopal Party from any Deſign
of Corrupting it, we muſt therefore acknowledge our ſelves Guilty.</p>
                  <p>We do not ſay it was <hi>deſignedly</hi> done, nor do I know any body that ſays ſo (and
un-ſaith it again in another humour) but the inconſiſtent Rector. We ſay the Preſs
was in the Hands of the Church-Party when it was firſt done, and therefore in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40622:12"/>
they muſt be charg'd with the Error of the Preſs. Had the Preſs been in <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
Hands, the Rector wou'd have urged it for a Demonſtration, that certainly
they were Guilty of the Corruption, becauſe it firſt happen'd when they had the
Power of the Preſs: But the Preſs was in <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Hands, therefore the Corruption
muſt be at their Door.</p>
                  <p>If one would allow himſelf the Liberty of Arguing from the ſame Topicks with
the Rector, he might retort the Charge of Corrupting this Place on the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi>
Party, and that deſignedly too. <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Preſs was in their Hands in Thirty Eight,
when the firſt Corruption happen'd. <hi>2ly.</hi> It was in their Hands, when moſt of the
reſt happen'd, and who ſhould be Guilty of Corrupting the Place, but thoſe that
had Power to do it, without Suſpicion? <hi>3ly.</hi> The Corruption favours the Peoples
Power in making their own <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Now it's certain, the Epiſcopal Party take
the Deacons in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. to be <hi>real Miniſters,</hi> which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do not: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Corruption favours their Opinion, and they may be ſuppoſed the Guilty
Perſons. It does not favour the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Sence of that Place, and it does that
of the <hi>Epiſcopaliſts.</hi> 4. It favours a Principle much in Vogue among the Church-Party,
eſpecially about Thirty Eight, that all <hi>Power is Originally in the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Principle is aſſerted by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> the Oracle of the Epiſcopal-Men, in his

                  <p>Here is <hi>Four</hi> Arguments to the Rectors <hi>Four</hi> Arguments, and every one of them
as good as his, but far be it from me to Charge either the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> or <hi>Diſſenting</hi>

more are, and proceeds from the careleſsneſs of the Corrector (who I hear is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

                  </p>
                  <p>I cou'd eaſily enlarge upon theſe Arguments, and make 'em look more Probable

                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> It it uncertain whether Coll. <hi>Fairfax</hi> reported it. Mr. <hi>Milne</hi> who is made
a Party to this Story, Affirms he never was in Company with Coll. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> nor
did he ſee him when he was at <hi>Rochdale,</hi> being from home that day, ſo that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
depends upon the ſingle Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Piggot,</hi> which how far it will paſs, I
leave to thoſe to judge who know the Man, and the manner of his Converſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> If Coll. <hi>Fairfax</hi> reported it, it does not at all make it unqueſtionable, for
it is but a ſingle Evidence, nor does he ſay, he heard the <hi>Cameronian</hi> himſelf urge
this Corrupt reading, perhaps the Story paſſed twenty Hands before it reach'd him;
nor does he Name the <hi>Perſon,</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> or <hi>Time,</hi> which are ſhrew'd Evidences,
that the Story is Spurious. Such a blind Evidence as this, would look ridiculous
in a Court of Juſtice, but ſerves the Rector's turn, who does not pretend to obſerve
the troubleſome <hi>Forms of Juſtice</hi> in the Management of his <hi>Charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly.</hi> This Story ſeems to have been the Entertainment <hi>over their Cups</hi> (where
every thing that is ſaid is not Goſpel), for as he tells us, they <hi>ſent for Bibles from
private Houſes:</hi> One may conclude then they were now at a <hi>Publick Houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This confirms the Truth of what I ſuſpected in my <hi>Remarks,</hi> p. 12. That he had
pick'd up a ſpurious Story, perhaps in the next <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Ale-Houſe,</hi> and this
he legitimates and recommends from the Pulpit, as a <hi>Sacred Oracle of God.</hi> The
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40622:13"/>
Rector muſt needs Grace the Pulpit, when he borrows <hi>Materials</hi> for his <hi>Sermons</hi> out
of the <hi>Cann-Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> His <hi>German</hi> Gentleman is a Stranger, and wants a Voucher for his Varacity,
but by his own Account one may ſuſpect he had been in <hi>Scotland</hi> aſſiſting at the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Butcheries</hi> there, and <hi>Dragooning</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> into Conformity: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, he charges not the <hi>German</hi> Presbyteriaas, no nor the <hi>Scotch</hi> with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the Word of God, tho' he complements 'em with the Title of <hi>Knaves.</hi>
Who he means by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> is doubtful, for there are no <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Biſhops</hi> there of the <hi>Engliſh Species.</hi> If one may judge <hi>ex Vngue Leonem,</hi> this
<hi>German</hi> was a <hi>Popiſh Soldier of Fortune,</hi> and condemns all the <hi>German Proteſtants</hi> for
<hi>Knaves:</hi> Or he was a bigotted <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and lov'd the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as the Rector does
the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> Is not the Rector aſhamed to creep into <hi>Ale-Houſes,</hi> and
there to muſter up <hi>Red-Coats</hi> if not <hi>Papiſts</hi> for Evidence againſt us? He brings for
Evidence againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a <hi>Scotch Cameronian,</hi> he brings for Evidence againſt
the <hi>Scotch</hi> a <hi>German Papiſt.</hi> Moſt Noble Rector! Your way of proving Matters of
Fact is very Singular, you prove your <hi>Cameronian</hi> Story by one ſingle Witneſs, and
what he Depoſes is by hear-ſay: You prove the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians
to be all <hi>Knaves</hi> by another ſingle Witneſs and he an out-landiſh one. We need
not go as far as <hi>Germany</hi> for Witneſſes to prove you <hi>Knaviſh</hi> in the Management of
your Charge. So much of his <hi>Cameronians</hi> STORY.</p>
                  <p>He has the Impudence to defend his Imputing the unproved Error of one <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronian</hi>
to all the <hi>Engliſh Presbyterians.</hi> 
                     <q>Thus, ſaith he, <hi>Haman</hi>'s Offence was
reveng'd upon many Thouſands of Perſons, and <hi>Sauls</hi> upon Seven of his Children,
and the <hi>Note-maker</hi> fell foul upon the whole Body of the Epiſcopal Church, for
a ſuppoſed Fault of my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                     </q> p. 48.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> deſtroying ſo many Thouſands of Perſons, was not to revenge <hi>Haman</hi>'s
Offence, but to defend themſelves againſt thoſe that aſſaulted them, as is expreſly
affirm'd in <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8. 11. and 9. 2. The Rector is ſo taken up with <hi>Cameronian</hi> Stories,
that he is not at leiſure to acquaint himſelf with Scripture Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>It's true <hi>Seven of Saul</hi>'s <hi>Sons were hang'd up unto the Lord</hi> (to whom they had
forfeited their Lives) at the deſire of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> had deſtroy'd
contrary to the <hi>Oath of God:</hi> But what is this to the imputing of the Error of one
Man, whoſe Name no body knows, to all the Presbyterians of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
The Rector is good at proving, I wou'd adviſe him to pick up ſome other
Story to prove all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of both Nations, to be the Natural Off-ſpring
of this <hi>Cameronian,</hi> and when he has done ſo, let him play the <hi>Gibeonite,</hi> and <hi>hang
them up</hi> with the Sons of <hi>Saul.</hi> 'Tis well we are not at this Man's Mercy; the very
<hi>Gibeonites</hi> contented themſelves with Seven of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Sons, but the Rector as if he
were of the Remnant of <hi>Amaleck,</hi> ſeeks with <hi>Haman</hi> to revenge the Fault of <hi>One</hi>
upon a whole Party.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Note-maker</hi> from whom he wou'd borrow a Plea for his <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> will do him
no Service, for he does not Charge any <hi>Perſonal Fault</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole Body of the <hi>Epiſcopal Church.</hi> He only take occaſion (as far as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
for it's ſome time ſince I read him) from the <hi>Biſhops</hi> charging the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with <hi>Schiſm,</hi> to retort it upon the Church, which he thinks Guilty of it.</p>

                  <hi>HAVING anſwer'd his Four Arguments I offered more Conſiderations to ſhew
the Falſity of the Rectors Charge, as</hi> 1ſt. <hi>No</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters have ever
urged that corrupt reading in favour of a Popular Government of the Church in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
Let him produce, if he can, any one Argument ſupported by this falſe reading in all
their Writings.</p>
               <p>All that the Rector pretends to ſay to this, is, <q>That it is a bold Touch, to be
ſo Poſitive in a <hi>Negative.</hi>
                  </q> p. 48.</p>
               <p>Why does not he prove the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> when I challenge him to it? I will be bold
to maintain the <hi>Negative,</hi> until he has prov'd the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> which I am ſure he
can never do.</p>
               <p>But one Mr. <hi>Jolly</hi> (as he tells us) ſome while ago, ſince <hi>Dead,</hi> alledg'd this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
reading at <hi>Duckenfield</hi> Hall, in diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Elliſon</hi> Rector of <hi>Aſhton un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Line. p.</hi> 48.</p>
               <p>The Rector of <hi>Bury</hi> and his Brother of <hi>Aſhton under Line,</hi> are well adviſed in
their Reports, the one tells a Story of a <hi>Nameleſs Cameronian</hi> in another Kingdom,
the other Names his Perſon, but you muſt look for him in another World. They
are reſolved to put us out of all Hopes of being ever able to Examine the Truth of
their Tales.</p>
               <p>He tells ſuch another Story (in which no Perſon are named) of ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in <hi>Bolton,</hi> who heard ſome Diſſenters in a diſpute about Religion, Cite <hi>Acts</hi> 6.
as the <hi>Cameronian</hi> did, and appeal'd to the <hi>Scotch Bibles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this laſt Paſſage I ſuſpect this Story to have come out of the ſame <hi>Mint</hi> with
the Former, for very few of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Bibles are miſ-printed, as we ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make appear.</p>
               <p>'Tis obſervable that neither Mr. <hi>Elliſon,</hi> nor the Gentleman at <hi>Bolton,</hi> do ſay,
That theſe Diſſenters urged this Corrupt reading to prove the Peoples Power in
making their own Miniſters, only that they read <hi>ye</hi> for <hi>we,</hi> which they might ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
do (finding it ſo in their Bibles) and not urge it as an Argument to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
an Error.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they might refer to that Place, to prove the Peoples Power to chuſe their
own <hi>Miniſters</hi> which is there aſſerted, without this Corrupt reading.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe they miſ-applied this Falſe reading, it was their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which no
Man will juſtify.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Ay, but doubtleſs they had been furniſhed with this Argument by ſome of
their <hi>Leaders.</hi>
                  </q>—p. 49.</p>
               <p>He ought to prove that, before he affirm with ſuch aſſurance. If any of his
Flock ſhou'd miſtake the Senſe of any Scripture, he wou'd think it hard to be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Error.</p>
               <p>Let him Name if he can, any of their <hi>Leaders</hi> that have ever recommended this
Falſe reading to their <hi>People,</hi> and I do promiſe we ſhall renounce him as unworthy
the Name of a Chriſtian, much more of a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>But he hath had named unto him one of their <hi>Leaders,</hi> Mr. <hi>R. Baldwin</hi> (his Mr.
<hi>Calvin),</hi> who detected and cenſured this <hi>Corruption,</hi> in an <hi>Ordination</hi> Sermon long
before his <hi>Rectorſhip.</hi>

And there are ſome who well remember, that the Reverend Mr. <hi>Philip Henry</hi>
many Years ago in his Expoſition of <hi>Acts</hi> 6. took notice of the Miſ-printing of <hi>ye</hi>
for <hi>we</hi> in ſome Editions, and took Care to rectify it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>'Tis remarkable here, as he goes on, how the Diſſenters more eſpecially appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Bibles. I believe Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> will be <hi>Wiſer</hi> then to give a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of the Corrupted Editions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' he has in Part promiſed it. I
ſhall be beholden to him, if he'l be pleaſed to Anſwer my Expectation herein.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>I am willing to oblige him, if poſſible, and to perform my Promiſe, I wrote to
the Reverend Doctor <hi>Rule,</hi> Principal of the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who ſent me
this Account of the <hi>Scotch Editions;</hi> I ſhall give it in his own Words—<q>It requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome time to ſearch for our Impreſſions of the Bible. I find there was one in
1673. which is out of Print, I can find no Copy of it. One 1676. <hi>Octavo,</hi> which
in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. hath <hi>we.</hi> One 1678. <hi>Quarto,</hi> hath <hi>we.</hi> One 1691. <hi>Octavo,</hi> hath

1675. <hi>Twelves</hi> hath <hi>ye.</hi> One 1686. hath <hi>ye:</hi> This laſt was finiſhed in 1688.
ſo that there were none printed here with that Corruption, ſave two (ſome ſpeak
of a third, but I cou'd not find it) and both theſe under <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi>
                  </q> Thus far

<hi>Whom ye may appoint over this Buſineſs,</hi> inſtead of <hi>whom We may appoint:</hi> Therefore
the General Aſſembly do unanimouſly declare, that as they allow no Power in the People, but

               <p>This Vote as Dr. <hi>Rule</hi> adds, <q>is a full and ſufficient Vindication of <hi>Scotch</hi>
                     <hi>Presbyterians</hi> from the Aſperſion of Corrupting the Word of God, which the

nor only do we abhor ſuch Practices, knowing that the Truth of God is not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by our Lie, But that Corruption of the Text ſhou'd deſtroy our Principle
about the <hi>Authoritative Miſſion</hi> of Church Officers, ſo far 'tis from affirming it.
The Story of the <hi>Cameronian</hi> Preacher may be look'd on as a meer Fiction: For
tho' in our Aſſembly are Miniſters and Elders from all <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> none

I deſire the Reader here to obſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> That the <hi>Cameronian</hi> Story, with which the Rector has made ſuch a Noiſe, is
not ſo much as known in <hi>Scotland.</hi> It ſeems then to have been contrived in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and perhaps at <hi>Rochdale,</hi> with deſign to furniſh the Rector with proper Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
for his Corruption—Sermon. It was Calculated for the Meridian of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
tho' it might indifferently ſerve for any Part of <hi>England.</hi> The Epiſcopal <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
in <hi>Scotland</hi> have publiſhed abundance of extravagant Stories to reproach the
Eſtabliſhment there, but can any one imagine they wou'd overlook the Rectors Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
had there been the leaſt Colour for it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> It falls out a little unluckily that the two <hi>Scotch Editions,</hi> that were miſ-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
happen'd under the Biſhops there, and that when they were in full Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly. Cann</hi>'s <hi>Scotch</hi> Edition hath <hi>we,</hi> as the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> ones have, which I Noted
in my <hi>Remarks.</hi> He was a rigid <hi>Browniſt,</hi> but did not miſ-print this Place. So much
of the <hi>Scotch Editions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. I <hi>Remark'd</hi> that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have written ſeveral <hi>Commentaries</hi> on the New
Teſtament, and not one of them have attempted to confirm the Corrupt reading in
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3.</p>
               <p>This Obſervation which clears 'em from Deſigning to Corrupt that Place, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
overlooks.</p>
               <p>III. I argued, that had the Corruption been deſign'd in favour of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
it wou'd have been promoted when they were <hi>uppermoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But having examined moſt Editions between 1640, and 1684. I can find but
three Corrupt Editions under the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And no leſs than thirty three under
King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. a Table of which I have given in my <hi>Remarks.</hi> Moſt of the
Corrupt Editions were in that Reign, when the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> were <hi>uppermoſt</hi> and
had the ſole Management of the Preſs.</p>
               <p>To this he ſaith, <hi>1ſt.</hi> 
                  <q>the Diſſenters need not when they were <hi>uppermoſt,</hi> for
they had gain'd their Point by the Sword.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>Was there ever a more impertinent Caviller? His Argument above was, they
Corrupted the Word of God, becauſe <hi>Presbytery</hi> was in the <hi>Aſcendent,</hi> but now they
are in the <hi>Vertical,</hi> he knows not whether they <hi>wou'd Corrupt it or no:</hi> That is when
they had not the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Preſs</hi> he ſuſpects they Corrupted this Place, but when
they had the Power of it, he allows they did not Corrupt it.</p>
               <p>His next Anſwer is more abſur'd, which is thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> 
                  <q>Tho' moſt of the faulty Editions were ſet forth in King <hi>Charles</hi> II. Days,
when the Diſſenters were undermoſt, yet they may be ſuppoſed to have promoted
the Corruption even then.</q> p. 49.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Suppoſe</hi> is one Thing, to <hi>Prove</hi> an other, one may ſuppoſe twenty ill Things of
the Rector, as that he is unſound in his <hi>Principles,</hi> ſecretly Corrupt in his <hi>Morals,</hi>
and a diſguiſed <hi>Adverſary</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> wou'd he like it, that ſome uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perſon ſhould report this? And when he calls upon him to prove it, to come off
with telling him, I did but ſuppoſe it? In this Manner he ſerves us, inſtead of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he ſuppoſes. He has forgotten the old Maxim of the Schools, <hi>ſupponere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> He adds, <q>the Biſhops had not in King <hi>Charles</hi> II. Reign the Management
of the Preſs: It's in the Hands of <hi>Patentees,</hi> who cannot eaſily be controul'd in
their buſineſs. The Biſhops have no Authority, ſo much as to Correct the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of the Bible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal Party (p.</hi> 15 and 17.) had the Management of
the Preſs, and that he cannot deny. It's certain the <hi>Biſhops</hi> had as much Power over

If the Biſhops have no Power to Correct the Impreſſions of the Bible, they may
depute able Perſons to review 'em, and if they find them faulty, they may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to the King, to whom he ſaith the Printers are anſwerable, and get 'em
puniſhed according to Law.</p>
               <p>Let the Biſhops Power be what it will, it's nothing to the Argument in Hand,
which is this, The Diſſenters can't be Charg'd with the Errors of the Preſs in King
<hi>Charles</hi> II. time, becauſe the Epiſcopal Party were uppermoſt, and had the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Preſs, with which the Diſſenters had nothing to do: Except it were in
the publiſhing an <hi>Octavo</hi> Impreſſion of the <hi>Britiſh Bible,</hi> which was promoted by the
Charity and Pains of that <hi>great exemplar of Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Gouge,</hi>

becauſe they are the only Impreſſions of the Bible (that I ever cou'd hear of)
Corrected by <hi>Diſſenting Miniſters,</hi> and they might have been eaſily Corrupted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Knowledge of the Printers (who are Strangers to the <hi>Britiſh Language)</hi> had
the Diſſenters any deſign to falſify the Scriptures, as the Rector ſuppoſeth. Theſe
two Impreſſions, Corrected by <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> are a ſufficient Vindication of them, from

               <p>Obſerve this Man's Candor, he ſuggeſts, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> who were <hi>uppermoſt</hi> in
King <hi>Charles</hi> II. time, could not <hi>Controul</hi> the King's Printers <hi>to prevent Corruptions,</hi>
and yet inſinuates as if the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who were <hi>undermoſt,</hi> cou'd <hi>Controul</hi> 'em, <hi>to

               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> I gave a Reaſon already, why it's very poſſible an Error in one Edition of the
Bible may be eaſily <hi>propagated,</hi> becauſe the Frames are often kept intire, which is
not done, or very rarely in other Books. I gave this Reaſon in my Remarks, but
he overlook'd it, and puts me to the trouble of repeating it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> I have prov'd that the frequent repetition of the Miſtake was when the Biſhops
were in ſupreme Power, and the Preſs in the Hands of the Epiſcopal Party. They
therefore muſt bear the blame of it, who ought to have given us more <hi>Correct E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> Since he puts me upon it, I will give him an inſtance of a Corruption, a
thouſand times Worſe than a miſtake in Printing, whereupon a Controverſy in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
depends, repeated in all the Editions of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> I have yet met
with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The words are in the Office of</hi> Commination, Curſed is the Man that maketh any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or melten Image to worſhip it. <hi>Theſe Words are ſaid, to be taken out of</hi> Deut.
27. 15. <hi>where they are thus,</hi> Curſed be the Man that maketh any graven or molten I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
an abomination unto the Lord, the work of the Hands of the Crafts-Man, and
putteth it in a ſecret Place.—</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Liturgy</hi> the words, <hi>to worſhip it,</hi> are added to the <hi>Text,</hi> which denounceth a
<hi>Curſe</hi> upon ſuch as make an Image for any <hi>Religious Ends,</hi> as ſuppoſe to beget in us
<hi>good reflections,</hi> to be a help to our <hi>Devotions,</hi> &amp;c. but the <hi>Addition</hi> reſtraineth the
Curſe to the Act or Intention of Adoration. Now there is a Controverſy of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Conſequence than that of <hi>ye</hi> and <hi>we,</hi> depends upon this Addition, <hi>viz. whether
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40622:15"/>
it be lawful to uſe Images</hi> (as ſuppoſe a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>for Religious Ends, provided we
don't worſhip them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Papiſts ſay, it's not only lawful, but in ſome Caſes neceſſary, that they are
<hi>Laymen's Books</hi> and great helps to Devotion: The Proteſtants affirm according to the
Scripture, they ought not to be made at all for the Ends of Religion, much leſs ſet
up either in the Congregation, or in a <hi>ſecret Place.</hi> Deut. 27. 15. Iſa. 44. 10.
Habb. 2. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Addition in the</hi> Liturgy <hi>ſeems to favour the</hi> Popiſh Doctrine, that we may uſe
Images in our Devotions, provided we don't worſhip them.</p>
               <p>I am the more Confirm'd in this by the <hi>Images of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,</hi> which I
find Printed in ſeveral of our <hi>Common-Prayers,</hi> and I doubt not but they are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as <hi>helps to Devotion,</hi> and I wiſh they were not deſigned as an Introduction to
<hi>Image Worſhip</hi> in the late Reigns, when projects of that kind were conniv'd at.</p>
               <p>However this be, the making of ſuch Images is againſt the Scriptures, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>2d.</hi> Commandment, as is prov'd at large in the <hi>Book of Homilies.</hi> It's ſhew'd
there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> 
                  <q>That no Image of Chriſt can be made but a LYING IMAGE, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is God and Man: Nor can any true Image of his Body be made, becauſe
it is unknown now of what Form and Countenance he was; and there be in <hi>Greece</hi>
and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other Places, divers Images of Chriſt, and none of them
like to other, and yet every of them affirmeth, that theirs is the True, which
cannot poſſibly be. Therefore as ſoon as an Image of Chriſt is made, by and by
is a <hi>LYE</hi> made of him, which by God's Word is forbidden.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> 
                  <q>If an Image of Chriſt cou'd truly be made, yet it is unlawful that it
ſhould be made, yea or that the Image of any Saint ſhou'd be made, eſpecially
to be ſet up in Temples. <hi>Ireneus</hi> reproves the Hereticks call'd <hi>Gnosticks</hi> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
about the Image of Chriſt. In the ſame <hi>Homily</hi> is proved the unlawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſuch Images from <hi>Lev. 26. Exod,</hi> 20. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. and they quote
this <hi>laſt Text aright,</hi> without the <hi>Addition</hi> in the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Serm. againſt Peril of Idolatry, <hi>Part 3d.</hi>
                     </note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>One may juſtly wonder, that ſuch a publick Uſe of Images ſhou'd be allow'd in
our Churches, and no Body that I hear of, reprove or condemn it, tho' all our <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Miniſters</hi> have ſubſcribed to the <hi>Book of Homilies,</hi> as containing a <hi>Godly and
wholſome Doctrine.</hi> The having of Images in our Books of publick <hi>Devotions</hi> is as
unjuſtifiable as the ſetting 'em up in our publick Churches, nay the former is in this
reſpect Worſe than the latter, becauſe in the latter Caſe, one Image ſerves a whole
Congregation, but in the former there are as many Images as there are Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
with <hi>Pictur'd Common-Paryer-Books</hi> in their Hands.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians ſhou'd avoid all Occaſions and Appearances of Idolatry, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
Zeal runs another Way. I will not tempt him to execute the fiery Sentence
(he paſſed on the Bible) upon his Common-Prayer, but I will recommend to his
Reading the learned and pious <hi>Homilies againſt Idolatry,</hi> which mention with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
<q>
                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s renting a painted Cloth; wherein was a Picture of Chriſt,
or of ſome Saint, affirming it to be againſt our Religion, that any ſuch Image
ſhou'd be had in the Temple or Church.</q> If this Act of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> does not raiſe
an Emulation in him to purge his Church of Images, he ought at leaſt to declare
againſt the <hi>Corruption of Scripture</hi> to which he is acceſſary, by giving <hi>his Aſſent and
Conſent to all and every Thing</hi> contain'd in the <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have gratified his Requeſt, and given him ſuch an Inſtance as he deſires,
and yet I will not ſay, this is a Corruption of which all the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> is Guilty,
becauſe I believe few of 'em have taken notice of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:40622:16"/>
For a farther Confirmation of his Charge againſt the Diſſenters, he ſaith, <q>out
of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Speech that the <hi>Puritans</hi> expung'd part of the XX. Articles
of the Church of England, <hi>concerning the Power of the Church to decree Rites and
Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis yet <hi>Sub-Judice,</hi> whether that Clauſe was added by ſome of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Friends,
or expung'd by ſome of their Adverſaries, whether it were the one or t'other, it
does not concern the Controverſy in Hand: Tho' it may ſeem more probable they
were added by ſome <hi>Ceremonious Gentleman,</hi> for the <hi>Puritans</hi> alledged <hi>that the Clauſe
was not to be found in the</hi> Latine, <hi>or</hi> Engliſh <hi>Articles of</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. <hi>or Queen</hi>
Elizabeth, <hi>ratified by Parliament.</hi> The Arch-Biſhop can't ſay, that this Clauſe was
in the Articles of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. but comes off with this ſly Anſwer, <hi>That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
made in the time of King</hi> Edward VI. <hi>were not now in Force, and therefore not
Material whether that Clauſe be in or out</hi>

               <p>I thought <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> were not like <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> to be repealed at
pleaſure. However, one may conclude from Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Words, that the
<hi>Clauſe about Ceremonies</hi> was not in the <hi>Original Articles</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

as he does of all the Editions that had it in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time. <hi>If it was to be
found in the Records of Convocation,</hi> Anno 1562. as the Arch-Biſhop ſaith, it is a ſign
the Church of England was grown more <hi>Ceremonious</hi> than it had been in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

adds,</hi> who ever thought that <hi>ye</hi> had any thing to do with the Ceremonies?</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 52.</p>
               <p>I ſpoke of the <hi>Corrupt reading</hi> as applied to a <hi>popular Government,</hi> which is evident
by my Words. I Note this as an Inſtance of his Unfairneſs, and paſs by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid, That</hi> he confidently Affirms, without Proof, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Bibles are generally
Faulty in this Paſſage: <q>
                     <hi>This is an</hi> impudent Slander, <hi>ſaith he, not to be Parallel'd
except,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſee the Rector does not love <hi>impudent Slanders,</hi> when himſelf is the <hi>Subject</hi> of

               </p>
               <p>But I will make it appear that I have not Slander'd him. He owns, he ſaid, <hi>he
had juſt Reaſon to ſuſpect the</hi> Scotch <hi>Editions,</hi> but takes no notice of his Saying in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Place, <hi>that the</hi> Kirk <hi>tampers with and refines upon the Word of God,</hi> Serm. p. 26.
and in p. 25. he ſaith, the <hi>Cameronian</hi> Preacher bid the Congregation turn to their

               </p>
               <p>Let any one judge whether all this does not amount to a <hi>confident Affirmation that
the</hi> Scotch <hi>Bibles are Faulty in this Paſſage.</hi> A Man of Truth ſhou'd not Affirm what
he is aſham'd to own.</p>
               <p>He vindicates the motion he made in his <hi>Sermon</hi> to burn the Bible: <q>But why
burn the Holy Bible for one ſingle Corruption? Why? Becauſe an Error which
appears in Maſquerade, and under the Diſguiſe of Scripture being diſcover'd
deſerves no pity, being of ſo much the more dangerous Conſequence.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 53.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:40622:16"/>
This Man knows not how to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Error.</hi> May not an
<hi>Error</hi> be condemn'd without ſacrificing a whole Volume of <hi>Divine Truths</hi> to the
Flames? It's true, an <hi>Error</hi> deſerves <hi>no pity,</hi> but the <hi>Bible</hi> deſerves our <hi>veneration.</hi>
The Rector ſerves the <hi>Bible</hi> as he has done the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> condemns the <hi>whole,</hi> for <hi>one</hi>
Error of the Preſs.</p>
               <p>Unthinking Soul! He has condemn'd the Holy Bible to be burnt for one <hi>ſingle Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>
and in the ſame Diſcourſe has endeavour'd to prove that there are <hi>ſeveral
Corruptions</hi> in all our <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and conſequently in all our <hi>Engliſh Bibles</hi> which are a
<hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaith, two Thouſand Years are loſt in the <hi>Chronology</hi> of our <hi>Hebrew</hi> (and ſo of

               </p>
               <p>Thus he has in effect condemn'd all our Bibles to the Fire. The very <hi>Papiſts</hi> leave
the <hi>Original Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and their <hi>vulgar Verſion</hi> untouch'd, but the good <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>

but the <hi>Latin, Greek, Engliſh,</hi> &amp;c. Bibles which are all Corrupt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 10.
according to the Rector, ſo that he has condemn'd to be Burnt <hi>all the Bibles in the
Chriſtian World,</hi> which according to him have at leaſt a <hi>ſingle Corruption,</hi> and this is
Cauſe enough why they ſhou'd be Burnt, as he wou'd have us believe.</p>
               <p>He wou'd do well to tell the World <hi>what Religion he is of,</hi> for I think all <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
diſcover an <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> towards the Holy Bible, which in us he miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets

               <p>HIS laſt Chapter has nothing in it of Argument that concerns the main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it conſiſts of Invectives and unjuſt Reflections upon two worthy Perſons,
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>P.</hi> that are gone to <hi>reſt,</hi> and never that I heard of diſturb'd <hi>his,</hi>
when they were alive: Nor do my <hi>Remarks</hi> give him the leaſt Occaſion to beſpatter
the Memories of theſe <hi>Good Men,</hi> but they were <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> which is Motive enough
to the Pious <hi>Rector</hi> to embalm their Names with ſuch Perfumes as his <hi>Repoſitory</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth.</p>
               <p>He begins with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whom he had accuſed of <hi>Corrupting the Word of God,</hi> in
leaving out the word <hi>theſe</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28.</p>
               <p>I anſwered, <hi>1ſt.</hi> That Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not pretend to Cite the Words of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi>
in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. but gives the Reaſon on which it was grounded, had he cited
the words of the Text, he wou'd have render'd 'em in the <hi>ſecond Perſon,</hi> it ſeem'd
good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon YOU no greater Burthen, but
he ſpeaks in the <hi>third Perſon,</hi> it ſeem'd good to the Holy Ghoſt and them, to lay upon
them.</p>
               <p>The Rector unfairly ſuppreſſes part of the Sentence by an, <hi>&amp;c. It ſeem'd good to
the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</hi> &amp;c. and then cries out, <hi>what a goodly Remarker</hi> is this,
to US in the <hi>ſecond Perſon,</hi> as if I had miſtaken one Perſon for another. But it is
plain by my Words that I refer the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> to the following Words <hi>to lay upon
YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>,</hi> which he left out with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that this unfair dealing might not appear.</p>
               <p>He fills half a Page with a goodly declamation upon our Ignorance in the <hi>Engliſh
Accidence,</hi> and wou'd <hi>adviſe us to go to School again to learn the firſt Rudiments of all
Languages.</hi> p, 56.</p>
               <p>I cou'd heartily wiſh his Defects were no worſe than thoſe he <hi>untruly</hi> charges upon
us, but I fear he is yet to learn the <hi>firſt Rudiments of all Religion, Sincerity and Honeſty.</hi>
I wou'd remit him to the <hi>Divinity School</hi> to learn the IX. Commandment, <hi>not to bear
falſe Witneſs,</hi> but that he is obſtinately reſolved <hi>to burn</hi> that <hi>Book,</hi> which only can
teach him this Leſſon.</p>
               <p>However my Defence of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtands good, that he deſigned not to Cite the
very Words of the Text, but to refer to them. This the Rector could not deny,
which is enough to juſtify him againſt his Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had miſ-quoted Scripture, the <hi>Rector</hi> of all Men living ſhould
have held his Peace, for he is notoriouſly Guilty of this Fault, of which I gave <hi>Ten</hi>
Inſtances in his Sermon, and he has not been able to deny one of them, only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to excuſe it as well as he can. He miſ-quotes his very Text, <hi>diminiſhes</hi> and
<hi>adds</hi> to his Quotations at his Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>He puts <hi>inſtruction</hi> for <hi>admonition</hi> in <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 10. 11. leaves out the words, <hi>which I
command you,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. puts <hi>cover</hi> for <hi>ſhall be full,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 9. reads <hi>certify</hi>

                  <hi>till all be fulfilled,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. reads
<hi>ſeek out ſeven Men,</hi> inſtead of <hi>look ye out</hi> among you <hi>ſeven Men,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. ſo that
he has corrupted this very Scripture (by leaving out the Words, <hi>among you)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which he has made ſuch a Clamour, as if the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> had corrupted it.</p>
               <p>

There were <hi>two</hi> Things remarkable in his Sermon about Corrupting the Word of
God; the <hi>Firſt</hi> was his <hi>Text,</hi> from which he aggravated his Charge, and this he has
miſ-quoted; the <hi>Second</hi> was the Subject of his Charge in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. and this alſo he
has <hi>miſ-quoted,</hi> by putting <hi>ſeek</hi> for <hi>book,</hi> and omitting the Words <hi>among you:</hi> And
therefore it ill becomes him to aggravate Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. omitting the word <hi>theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> I find <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. in the <hi>Book of Homilies</hi> (to which the Rector has ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed)
quoted without the words <hi>theſe,</hi> 
                  <q>In the Acts of the Apoſtles we read that
they ſent word to the brethren, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. that it ſeemed good to the Holy
Ghoſt and to them, to charge them with no more than <hi>with neceſſary Things.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>He charges Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with Corrupting a Paſſage in <hi>Jerom</hi> in his <hi>Fifth Diſpute,</hi> which
I have not by me, and therefore can ſay nothing to it: But if it be miſ-quoted, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was by Accident, and not by <hi>Deſign</hi> as he ſuggeſts. Its evident that he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly</hi>
miſ-repreſented me, in ſaying I miſtook one Perſon for another, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his <hi>Deſign</hi> ſuppreſſeth that Part of the Sentence to which I refer'd; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have little Reaſon to believe his Accuſations of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or any body elſe, and
leſs Reaſon to believe he has ſuch an <hi>Averſion</hi> as he pretends, to that he unjuſtly
Charges us with, viz. <hi>a deſigned miſ-repreſentation of Authors.</hi> This he is notoriouſly
Guilty of, and which is a great deal worſe, <hi>he hath Corrupted the Word of God,</hi> which
I admoniſhed him of in my Anſwer to his <hi>Tentamen Novum,</hi> in which you may find
both Corruptions; one is in <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 19. where he reads, <hi>the</hi> reſt <hi>preached the Word,</hi>
&amp;c. inſtead of <hi>they that were ſcatter'd abroad— preached the Word,</hi> &amp;c. ſo our Bibles
have it according to the Original. This looks like a <hi>deſigned Corruption</hi> meerly to
ſupport his Argument, as the Reader may ſee in his <hi>Tentam. p.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>The other Corruption is of <hi>1 Cor. 5. 4. In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when
ye are gathered together and my Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. ſo our Bibles. The Rector reads it,— <hi>In
the Name of our Lord Jeſus—and</hi> of <hi>my Spirit,</hi> as if the Conſtruction were <hi>in the
Name of my Spirit,</hi> i. e. by my Authority, intimating that the whole Power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication

               <p>One wou'd think a Man that is Guilty of Corrupting the Scriptures ſhou'd not ſo

<hi>Laud</hi> guarded the Preſs againſt the <hi>Puritans. 3ly.</hi> It was in the Hand of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
Men. <hi>4ly.</hi> The Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where the firſt Corruption hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
was under the Government of Epiſcopal Perſons.</p>
               <p>As to his II. Argument, That the <hi>Corruption favours the Diſſenters,</hi> I have proved
that it does not favour any Opinion of theirs; that they look on the VII. Deacons
in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. as <hi>Ministers of Tables,</hi> and not of the Word and Sacraments; and that they
aſcribe the Power of <hi>Ordaining</hi> or <hi>Appointing</hi> Church-Officers unto the Miniſters
and not to the People.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to his III. Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Epiſcopal Party wou'd not Corrupt
this Place, becauſe it does not favour their Principles;</hi> I have ſhewed, that it was Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by them, and that ſeveral of 'em have aſſerted the <hi>Popular Principles,</hi> yet I
will not be ſo uncharitable as to affirm, that they have Corrupted it on Deſign to
advance theſe Principles: Tho' it were eaſy for a Man of the Rector's temper to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the Matter.</p>
               <p>I have ſufficiently confuted the <hi>Cameronian</hi> Story, which makes his IV. Argument,
and confronted the ſingle Teſtimony of Coll. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> (which is againſt an <hi>individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
vagum,</hi> without naming Perſon, Time or Place) with the Vote of the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And have ſhewed how unjuſtly he has Traduced the <hi>Scotch
Editions</hi> of the Bible, among which I can find but two that are Faulty, and thoſe
under the Biſhops there; as it is undeniable the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Corrupt Editions happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when the Preſs was in the Hands of <hi>Epiſcopal Perſons,</hi> who in Common Juſtice
muſt Anſwer for the Errors of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Four Arguments</hi> are the <hi>Sandy-Foundation,</hi> on which he builds ſo <hi>heavy a
Charge:</hi> Now the Foundation failing him, the Superſtructure falls on <hi>his own Head,</hi>
and the <hi>reputation</hi> of this fooliſh Maſter-Builder lies buried under the ruins of his
<hi>Malicious Contrivement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Having ſhew'd the weakneſs of his Arguments, I will give you a Taſt of his
Regard to the Word of God. While he is charging us with Corrupting it, he has
made the <hi>boldeſt Attempt</hi> perhaps of any Man living to undermine it.</p>
               <p>He has endeavour'd to expunge all the <hi>Titles of the Pſalms</hi> out of the <hi>Sacred Canon.</hi>
He has affirm'd <hi>Pſ.</hi> 72. 20. to be <hi>manifeſtly Falſe.</hi> He diſparages our <hi>Engliſh Bibles,</hi>
which agree with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and wou'd perſuade us that they are <hi>Corrupted</hi> by the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40622:19"/>
                  <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>material Things,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 96. 10. and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 12. He tells us
that two Thouſand Years are loſt in our <hi>Scripture-Chronology,</hi> ſo that according to our
<hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles it cannot be prov'd that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh. He
ſtands convicted of having <hi>Corrupted Acts</hi> 11. 19. and <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 5. 4. to ſerve a <hi>Corrupt
Deſign.</hi> He ſaith that but for Tradition, <hi>Plato, Senecae,</hi> and the Seven <hi>Wiſe Men of</hi>
Greece (and it's pity but he were made the Eighth) <hi>might lay claim to Inſpiration,</hi> as
well as the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>III. I will give an <hi>Idea</hi> of ſuch Vertues as ſhine forth in his <hi>Remarks</hi> on <hi>Remarks,</hi>
which render him a very <hi>remarkable</hi> Man.</p>
               <p>I will ſhew him the Beauties of his own Face in the beſt Glaſs with which he has
accommodated us, hoping that the charming Reflection of his own Form will not
tranſport him into an <hi>Adonic Paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> His <hi>Juſtice</hi> is ſo tranſcendent, that it cannot be confined to that vulgar Rule

                  </hi> This is a <hi>Tentamen Novum</hi> in <hi>Ethicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He has given us an Inſtance of this <hi>new Sort</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> in his <hi>Cameronian</hi> Story,
which he imputes to the whole Body of Diſſenters. I have read of One <hi>Haman,</hi>
who ſought to be reveng'd of <hi>all the Jews</hi> for One <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Offence, but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

able to do upon the <hi>Cameronian</hi> Preacher; and yet he has the <hi>Modeſty</hi> to Vindicate
this piece of <hi>Juſtice</hi> by telling us, <hi>p. 47. The</hi> Engliſh <hi>Presbyterians are like to bear
the Burthen of their Brethren in</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> His <hi>Truth</hi> is as remarkable as his <hi>Juſtice.</hi> He has advanced and attempted to
Confirm a <hi>Falſe Accuſation</hi> againſt the Diſſenters in General, eſpecially the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they have Corrupted the Word of God: And
yet wou'd have us believe that <hi>his Sermon was preach'd in Vindication of the Church of</hi>
England <hi>againſt</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who are not ſo much as named in the whole
Sermon. You have another Inſtance of his <hi>Truth,</hi> where he ſays, <hi>That, according to
Mr.</hi> Owen, <hi>the People belike ordain'd the Deacons. Remarks on Remarks, p.</hi> 4, 45.</p>
               <p>This is a notorious Un-truth, which may be look'd upon as the Off-ſpring of his
impregnated <hi>Wrath,</hi> and we may ſuppoſe he is the more fond of this <hi>Spurious Brat,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Sayings of Fathers</hi> are a <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> to him, (we will ſuppoſe of <hi>Practice</hi>
alſo) and he has quoted a very eminent Father, <hi>who,</hi> as the Rector ſaith, <hi>cared not
what in his Heat he ſaid or wrote for the ſupport of his own Opinion. p.</hi> 29. 18.</p>
               <p>The Story he tells of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> are farther Evidences of his Regard to
<hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> His <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are of a Piece with <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> for all the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> I will take Notice of his <hi>Charity</hi> to the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in General, concerning whom
he is convinced, <hi>that Meekneſs and Charity is due unto them,</hi> and as a rare Inſtance of
it, he wou'd have 'em ſtyled, <hi>the Foxes and Firebrands of the Church and Nation. p. 2,
3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He makes it <hi>Religious Hypocriſy</hi> in us to Style our Selves <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi>
which he and his Brethren ſeldom or never do, becauſe, I preſume, they reckon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
dignified by more <hi>honourable Titles. p.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>He falſly ſays, <hi>That the</hi> Socinians <hi>and almoſt all the Nation of</hi> Schiſmaticks <hi>and</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks

maintaining a <hi>ſingle Error in the Foundation</hi> denominate a <hi>Heretic,</hi> what ſhall
we call the Man, who has endeavour'd to over-throw the <hi>whole Foundation</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

by charging our Bibles with ſeveral <hi>material Corruptions,</hi> and condemning them

               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> We will give ſome Inſtances of his <hi>Charitable and Candid Temper</hi> towards par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſons, whom he abuſeth without the leaſt provocation.</p>
               <p>He begins with <hi>Jerom,</hi> that <hi>great Light of the Latin Church,</hi> of whom he ſaith,
<hi>he is unworthy to be believ'd in any Thing, that he cared not what in his Heat he ſaid or
wrote.</hi> In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he makes a <hi>Great R—gue</hi> of him, and yet at the ſame time
makes ſuch another of Mr. <hi>B—r, for reaping up the Faults of the Ancient Fathers.</hi> I
perceive Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Fault was that he intruded into the Rector's Province, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Priviledge it is to <hi>revile the Ancient Fathers,</hi> tho' he denies not but Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi>
are True, but I have proved his Character of <hi>Jerom</hi> to be Falſe. <hi>p.</hi> 18, 61.</p>
               <p>In a Word, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> either did well or ill in <hi>reaping up the Faults of the Fathers;</hi> if
<hi>well,</hi> why does the Rector with ſo much malignity <hi>cenſure</hi> him for it? If <hi>ill,</hi> who
does he <hi>imitate,</hi> him? <hi>p.</hi> 18, 61.</p>
               <p>He reflects on the Reverend Mr. <hi>Tallents,</hi> as if he wanted <hi>Integrity,</hi> tho' he can't
diſprove his Account of <hi>Cambridge</hi> in 1638, which Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> juſtifies. Here the

               <p>He reflects on his Majeſties Words,<note n="*" place="bottom">Serm. p. 25.</note> and hopes to Excuſe it, by telling us, he
<hi>derided</hi> only the <hi>Scotch-Reaſon,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>He reproaches the late Reverend Mr. <hi>P.</hi> as if <hi>be had Married his Wife without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

very gracious and merciful Providence.</q>

               <p>I am inform'd the <hi>Claſs-Rigiſter,</hi> a Copy of which the Rector ſaith is in his Hands,
contains a Vindication of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> who being accuſed of an irregular and clandeſtine
Marriage, produced a <hi>Certificate</hi> of the <hi>Conſent</hi> of <hi>Parents.</hi> If this be ſo, The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
is guilty of the baſeſt diſingenuity to revive a <hi>malicious Accuſation</hi> againſt a Man
in his Grave, and to ſuppreſs his <hi>Compurgation,</hi> whereby his Innocency was cleared.
Mrs. <hi>P.</hi> affirms, and will take it upon her Oath, if there be occaſion, that <hi>ſhe had
her Parents</hi> Conſent, <hi>and that Morning before ſhe was Married to Mr.</hi> P. <hi>ſhe had both
Father and Mother's</hi> bleſſing, <hi>and in the Evening they were both</hi> entertain'd <hi>and wellcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by her</hi> Parents.</p>
               <p>He quarrels with an <hi>innocent Paſſage</hi> in the Reverend Mr. <hi>O. H</hi>'s. <hi>Family Altar,</hi> the
deſign of which is to perſuade Perſons to keep up the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> in their <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
It's well if the Rector in his <hi>Parochial Viſitations</hi> be as forward to oblige his
<hi>Pariſhoners</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi> in their <hi>Families,</hi> as he is to ridicule a judicious Diſcourſe upon
the Subject of <hi>Family Prayer.</hi> It puts me in Mind of the <hi>Jews</hi> Treatment of the
Chriſtians, of which <hi>Juſt. Martyr</hi> gives this Account, <hi>tho' one ſhou'd ſpeak</hi> Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

            <head>THE
POSTSCRIPT,
Being an Anſwer to the Rector's 2d. Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he endeavours to prove the Titles of the Pſalms
to be no Parts of Scripture, and the Hebrew Bibles
to have been Corrupted in very material Things.</head>
            <p>IN purſuance to my promiſe, I will now examine his Digreſſion, about the <hi>Titles,</hi>
or <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and the <hi>Purity</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> of which our
<hi>Engliſh Bibles</hi> are a Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>I muſt here premiſe, that the Difference between the Rector and me about
the <hi>Hebrew Titles,</hi> and <hi>Copies</hi> is no point of Controverſy between the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi>
and the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> but I oppoſe a bold Paradox of his, which he endeavours to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
againſt the Common Sentiments of learned <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the more moderate
<hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the <hi>Titles of the Plalms,</hi> which becauſe he finds 'em omitted in
the <hi>Liturgy Tranſlation</hi> of the Pſalms, he attempts to exclude out of the <hi>Sacred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi>
We agree that they are very Ancient, but he is of Opinion they are <hi>humane
Additions,</hi> and that ſome of 'em are <hi>Falſe:</hi> I affirm, and undertake to prove that
they are of equal Authority with the reſt of the Pſalms, and to be admitted for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Scripture.</hi> Before we enter upon the debate of this Point, let it be conſider'd,
<hi>1ſt.</hi> That the Rector's Opinion is very ſingular, and has few or no Patrons in the
Chriſtian World at this Day. He has not hitherto been able to produce any one
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writer, or <hi>Chriſtian Commentator</hi> that has condemn'd 'em as Spurious and
Un-canonical. A wiſe Man is not Ambitious of being thought ſingular, eſpecially
in a doubtful Point, leaſt of all in an Error, and that of ſuch a Nature as ſtrikes at
the Authority of any Part of the <hi>inſpired Volumns. 2dly.</hi> Tho' the Titles of the Pſalms,
be but a ſmall Part of Scripture, and ſeveral of 'em obſcure, and hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
we muſt not therefore expunge them out of the Divine Canon, to which we
muſt neither add nor diminiſh. Every Word of God ought to be equally precious
to us, as being an Emanation from the ſame Fountain of un-erring Wiſdom and
Truth: Even the more abſtruſe, and ſeemingly leſs uſeful Parts of Scripture muſt
be received with the ſame Veneration, which is paid to thoſe that are more plain, and
do more ſenſibly concern us. <hi>3dly.</hi> If the Titles be Parts of the Holy Scripture, as
I ſhall prove immediately, the Rector ſtands <hi>convicted by his own Sermon</hi> of being <hi>a
Corrupter of the Word of God,</hi> for he endeavours to <hi>diminiſh</hi> from it.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this Subject, <hi>1ſt.</hi> I will vindicate my Arguments to prove the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of the Pſalms to be Canonical. <hi>2dly.</hi> I will anſwer his Objections to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

               <p>THE Rector having challenged us to prove the Titles to be <hi>Original and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Parts of Scripture,</hi> I propoſed a few Arguments for the Affirmative with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Deſign of entering into this Controverſy, as being foreign to his Charge: Theſe
he pretends to Anſwer, which I ſhall now Vindicate.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>My firſt Argument was this,</hi> That they are as Ancient as the Pſalms themſelves, for
ought appears to the Contrary, they being in all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek Copies</hi> that ever

               <p>Nothing can be inferr'd from theſe Subſcriptions in prejudice of my Argument,
becauſe, <hi>1ſt.</hi> They are not in all <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, as <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> with many
others have obſerv'd, and the Rector is forced to confeſs; but can he produce any
Copy of the <hi>Hebrew Pſalms</hi> that wants the <hi>Titles?</hi> The conſtant Conſent of all <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Copies beſpeaks 'em not only ancient but original Parts of Scriptures.</p>
               <p>2. The Poſtſcripts of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles are not the ſame in all ancient Manuſcripts,
and therefore ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> 
                  <q>they are of no Authority, becauſe they are not in all
ancient Copies, nor the ſame in thoſe that have 'em, and they are different in the
<hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> Copies:</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Nullius ſunt Authoritatis, quia nec in omnibus exemplaribus apparent, <hi>&amp;c. Grot. ad fin. Ep. ad Rom. Vid.</hi> Eſt. in loc.</note> But the Titles of the Pſalms are the ſame in all our
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, and ſo they were in thoſe which <hi>Jerom</hi> uſed, which is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they were not added, but are cover'd with the Text. When the Rector has
produced the like Variety in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies concerning the <hi>Titles,</hi> as is to be found
in the <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript concerning the <hi>Subſcriptions,</hi> he does ſomething to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
in the mean Time we'l diſmiſs his Argument as Impertinent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. My</hi> 2d. <hi>Argument was,</hi> That the Titles of the Pſalms were receiv'd by the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Church,</hi> and are by the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> as Canonical Scripture; they are Tranſlated
by the <hi>Jewiſh Doctors</hi> into <hi>Greek,</hi> and by <hi>Jerom</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> and they are in the modern
Verſions.</p>
               <p>To this he Anſwer, <q>That the Subſcriptions of <hi>Sr. Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles are Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the modern Languages, and all Chriſtian Churches receive them yet not as
Canonical Scripture: So the <hi>Jews</hi> receiv'd the Titles, but not as Eſſential Parts
of Scripture, but as we do the Poſtſcripts, and the Contents of the Chapters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I. That the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church received 'em, but not as eſſential Parts of Scripture
is barely affirm'd, and not prov'd. I challenge him to give us one Inſtance for the
confirmation of ſo bold an Aſſertion. The <hi>Jews</hi> receiv'd the Titles and the Body of
the Pſalms alike, we do not find that they made any difference in Point of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between the one and the other, they that affirm they did, ought to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> We reject the Contents of Chapters and the Poſtſcripts of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
from being Canonical, but he cannot prove the <hi>Jews</hi> did ſo by the Titles of the
Pſalms. They formerly received them as Parts of Scripture, and they do ſo ſtill in
our modern <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles, in which ſeveral of the Titles make the <hi>firſt Verſe</hi> of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40622:22"/>
Pſalms, as they do in ſeveral modern Tranſlations. Vid. <hi>Jun. &amp; Temell. Piſcat
Calvin.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> It's true, the Poſtſcripts are Tranſlated in the modern Languages, but moſt
Commentators wholly overlook 'em, or cenſure them as no Parts of Scripture: But
both <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Commentators explain the Titles of the Pſalms, as they
do other Scriptures, which is a clear Evidence they take 'em for Canonical.</p>
               <p>I will confirm this <hi>2d.</hi> Argument with another, which puts this Matter beyond
all Contradiction.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, to whom were committed the Oracles of God, receiv'd
the Titles of the Pſalms in the Apoſtles Time, they muſt needs be Canonical, for
the Scripture, as receiv'd by them, is of Divine Inſpiration, as the Apoſtle declares,
<hi>2 Tim,</hi> 3. 16. But they were receiv'd by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in the Apoſtles Time,
and long before, for they were in the Copy which the LXX. uſed, who tranſlated
ſome, and tranſcribed others, that ſtill agree with ſeveral of thoſe in our <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
They are to be found in the <hi>Syriac Verſion</hi> (I mean that out of the <hi>Hebrew)</hi>
which is generally aſcribed to the Age in which the Apoſtles lived, tho' <hi>Gabriel Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi>
refers it to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Time.</p>
               <p>And they are Tranſlated by <hi>Theodotion, Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> in the next Age
after the Apoſtles. Therefore they were received in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Age, and conſequently are of <hi>Divine Inſpiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. I added, that ſome of the Titles are undeniably Canonical, as that of</hi> Pſalm,
18th, <hi>mention'd in 2 Sam.</hi> 22. To the Chief Muſician, a Pſalm of <hi>David,</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Lord, who ſpake unto the Lord the Words of this Song, in the day that the
Lord deliver'd him from the Hand of all his Enemies, and from the Hand of <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It does not follow, ſaith the Rector, that an inſpired Perſon affixed it unto the
<hi>18 Pſalm.</hi> So that thoſe Words as placed before the <hi>18 Pſalm,</hi> may in ſtrictneſs be
ſaid not to be Canonical there, tho' they be Canonical, <hi>2 Sam.</hi> 22. p. 10.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What a miſerable ſhift is this poor Man put upon to avoid the Evidence of Truth?
The Title of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is <hi>Canonical</hi> and <hi>not Canonical, Scripture</hi> and <hi>no Scripture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired,</hi>
and <hi>not inſpired:</hi> It's <hi>Canonical</hi> with him in one Part of the Bible, it's a <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Addition</hi> in another. He does not pretend to give any Reaſon for ſo bold a Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion;
only you muſt believe, <hi>it is ſo becauſe it is ſo.</hi> However, it is enough to
my Purpoſe that he allows the Words of the Title to be Canonical in <hi>2 Sam.</hi> 22. There
you have the <hi>Pſalm</hi> and a <hi>Canonical Title</hi> prefix'd to it by his own Confeſſion. Hence
it evidently follows, that ſome <hi>Pſalms</hi> have Canonical Titles: And if ſome be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical,
the Titles of all the reſt muſt be ſo, for no Reaſon can be given, why ſome
ſhou'd be Divine, and others Humane, ſince all are equally Ancient, and of the
ſame date, for any thing can be made appear to the Contrary.</p>
               <p>If the Words be Canonical in <hi>2 Sam.</hi> 22, they are undeniable ſo in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Rector can prove them added by an un-inſpired Perſon, which he'l never be
able to do with all the help that <hi>F. Simon,</hi> or any of that Tribe can afford him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. My</hi> 4th <hi>Argument was, That</hi> other Titles muſt be prefixed by the Pen-Man, or
by a Perſon Divinely inſpired, for they refer to Paſſages of Hiſtory not mention'd in the
body of the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> I inſtanced in <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 3. and 30. and 34. and 54. and 56. and 90.</p>
               <p>To this he anſwers, <q>Tho' there be no particular and very obvious Expreſſions
relating to hiſtorical Paſſages, there are general Ones, which gave the Collectors
of the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> occaſion of affixing thoſe Titles to them.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>The general Expreſſions he talks of could never have directed 'em to ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Events as ſome Titles refer to. As for Inſtance, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 3. No general Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<hi>there</hi> can be applied more to <hi>Abſalom</hi> than to <hi>Saul,</hi> or others of <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies,
but that the Title of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> directs us to refer them to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> when <hi>David</hi>
fled before him.</p>
               <p>The Title of the <hi>30 Pſalm,</hi> is a Pſalm <hi>or Song at the Dedication of the Houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
There is not one Paſſage in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> that the moſt obſerving Man cou'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40622:23"/>
have applied to this Occaſion, rather than any other joyful Event, if the Holy Ghoſt
had not prefixed this Inſcription.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of <hi>Pſlam</hi> 34. which was Penn'd <hi>when</hi> David <hi>chang'd his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
before</hi> Abimelech, as the Title aſſures us, but there is nothing in the body of
the <hi>Pſalm</hi> but what might be equally applied to other deliverances.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be affirm'd of the other <hi>Pſalms</hi> I mention'd above, eſpecially of
<hi>Pſalm 90. A Prayer of Moſes the Man of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But ſaith the Rector, tho' <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> be not mention'd in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90.
yet many Verſes of that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> particularly the <hi>9th</hi> and <hi>10th,</hi> were thought to
allude to the Condition of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, whoſe Stubbornneſs
God puniſhed by cutting their Lives ſhort, <hi>i. e.</hi> reducing 'em to Seventy or Eighty
Years.</q>
               </p>
               <p>True, it alludes to the Condition of the People in the Wilderneſs, but who wou'd
have thought ſo, if the <hi>Title</hi> had not directed Interpreters to apply it to the State
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs? The Title occaſion'd this Application, and it was not
the Application which occaſion'd the Title, as he without Reaſon imagines. Here,
as in many other <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the Title is a Key that opens the deſign and meaning of
the Holy Ghoſt in the body of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as we find well obſerv'd by the late Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Arch-Biſhop <hi>Sancroft,</hi> in a Sermon upon a publick Occaſion on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 57. 1.</p>
               <p>But ſaith our Author, <q>if the Titles refer to Paſſages of Hiſtory not mention'd
in the body of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> this is a good Argument that they are not Canonical, but
the Conjectures of meer Men, which is the Reaſon (I ſuppoſe) why many <hi>Pſalms</hi>
have no Titles at all, and <hi>many have none to any Purpoſe at all.</hi>
                  </q> p. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> Tho' the hiſtorical Paſſages be not mention'd in the body of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it is
ſufficient they are mention'd in the Title, and that there is nothing in the <hi>Pſalm</hi>
that is inconſiſtent with it, nay the whole ſweetly agrees therewith, and is better
underſtood by the help of the Title, that leads us to the Scope and Occaſion of it,
which otherwiſe wou'd be more obſcure, and not ſo intelligible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Several <hi>Pſalms</hi> have no Titles at all, and that's an Argument they are not
additional Conjectures, for the ſame Hands might have given <hi>Conjectural Titles</hi> to
all, as well as to ſome <hi>Pſalms,</hi> at leaſt ſuch Titles as refer to the <hi>Pen-Man,</hi> or to
the <hi>Inſtruments of Muſick</hi> on which they were ſung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſuch <hi>Pſalms</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi>
found without Titles in their <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles, they left without, and they remain ſo
to this day; a ſign the Titles are not Conjectures of Men, but the Dictates of the
Holy Ghoſt. It had been an eaſy thing for bold Conjecturers to have added ſome
ſort of Titles to ſuch as are without, and had the Wit of Man the ordering of the
Matter, it wou'd have render'd 'em more uniform, and given 'em the ſame features,
and wou'd not have beſtow'd Titles upon ſome, and left others without.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> It wou'd have look'd more modeſt in the Rector to have ſaid, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not the Uſe of many Titles, than boldly, if not blaſphemouſly to affirm, <hi>that
many are to no Purpoſe at all.</hi> There are many obſcure Paſſages in the Holy Scriptures
which we underſtand not, are they therefore <hi>to no Purpoſe at all?</hi> Muſt they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pung'd
out of the ſacred Oracles? It's well, if the Prophecies of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and <hi>John
the Divine</hi> fall not under the Cenſure of this <hi>Corrupting expunger,</hi> for being abſtruſe
and obſcure. It's no wonder that a Man who dares thus reproach the Spirit of God,
the Author of the Titles of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſhou'd make no Conſcience of reviling his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
We know who ſaid, <hi>to what Purpoſe is this waſte?</hi> I doubt it is <hi>to little Purpoſe,</hi>
to Reaſon with one who is not afraid to Charge the Spirit of God with <hi>Impertinencies.</hi>
It will prove but a ſorry Excuſe to ſay he does not take the Titles of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> for
Parts of Scripture, he aggravates his Sin by excluding 'em firſt out of the Canon,
and when he has done by expoſing 'em to Scorn and Contempt. In like manner do
the <hi>Deiſts</hi> treat other Parts of Holy Writ, which they think they may ſafely Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule,
becauſe they don't believe 'em divinely inſpired.</p>

               <p>HAVING vindicated my Arguments for the Titles, I ſhall now conſider the
Rector's Objections againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> His firſt is this, <q>If ſome or any one Title may be <hi>juſtly</hi> queſtion'd, then this
renders all the reſt Suſpicious: and here he Queſtions the Titles of the 90 and 34
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> how <hi>juſtly</hi> we ſhall conſider preſently.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe one or two might be juſtly ſuſpected to be a Humane Additon, muſt
all the reſt be ſo? The Rector thinks he may juſtly Queſtion ſome Things in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies</hi>
and <hi>Chronology</hi> of the Old Teſtament of our <hi>Engliſh Bibles,</hi> does it follow
therefore that all our <hi>Scripture-Genealogies</hi> and <hi>Chronology</hi> are ſuſpicious? It muſt be
ſo according to the Rector's Logic: Thus by attempting to overthrow one Part of
Scripture, he levels his Argument in effect againſt the whole. He tells us in p. 13.
<hi>That the Book of</hi> Pſalms <hi>has receiv'd ſome Humane Additions,</hi> eſpecially <hi>at the end of</hi>
Pſalm 72. Here he puts an Argument into the Mouth of an <hi>Athieſt,</hi> that if ſome or
any one Part of the Scripture may be juſtly queſtion'd (as ſuppoſe the Words at the
end of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72. which he ſaith are <hi>manifeſtly Falſe)</hi> then this renders all the reſt
Suſpicious.</p>
               <p>How wou'd the Rector Anſwer his own Argument? He muſt grant the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, <hi>That if ſome part may be juſtly queſtion'd, the whole is
ſuſpicious,</hi> for it is his own Argument againſt the Titles of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> He argues
(abſurdly enough) <hi>à parte ad totum.</hi> He cannot deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> for he affirms that
ſome part of Scripture may be juſtly queſtion'd, as the Titles of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90. and 34.
and the laſt verſe of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72. He muſt therefore either acknowledge the weakneſs
of his Premiſſes, or deny the Concluſion, or yield unto an <hi>Athieſt, that all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are ſuſpicious.</hi> He can't deny the Concluſion, without expoſing the Reputation
of a <hi>Scholar,</hi> nor can he yield it in conſiſtency with that of a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> Therefore
he muſt confeſs the weakneſs of his Argument, that <hi>if one Title be queſtionable, all the
reſt are ſuſpicious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rector here treats the <hi>Pſalms</hi> with the ſame Juſtice which he has given the
Diſſenters; he condemns them all for the ſuppoſed Act of One (as in the Story of
the <hi>Cameronian)</hi> and he condemns all the Titles for the ſake of one or two, which
he thinks fit to Queſtion, as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Title of the <hi>90. Pſalm</hi> (A Prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.) ſeems not to have been
Compoſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the Age of Man in <hi>v.</hi> 10. is ſaid to be between Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

appears by the Age of <hi>Job, Kohath, Amram, Aaron, Joſhua, Miriam, Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
p. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>He is ſenſible of the weakneſs of his own Argument, and therefore adds,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It muſt be Confeſs'd, That this Point is bandy'd by learned Men, and ſundry

               <p>I will in a few Words diſpatch this Objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> conceive; that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks not of <hi>the Age of Man as ſuch,</hi>
but of the ſhort Lives of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, where all periſhed from

at Eighty, which Year, it ſhou'd ſeem by the Words of <hi>Moſes</hi> (Pſalm 90. 10.) few

               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Age of Man,</hi> as moſt Interpreters do think he doth,
he muſt be underſtood of the <hi>ordinary Meaſure</hi> of Man's Life, which is between Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty

               <p>The Rector therefore may as well quarrel with the <hi>90th Pſalm</hi> it ſelf that aſſerts
Man's Age to be <hi>Fourſcore Years,</hi> as he doth with the Title of it, which applies this
Meaſure to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs: For there is ſcarce a Countrey in which
one may not find ſeveral Old People that live beyond Fourſcore.</p>
               <p>He adds, <q>that ſeveral Authors in <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis</hi> deliver their Opinion very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly,

               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral Authors in <hi>Pool,</hi> to which the Rector refers, are but two, <hi>Muis</hi>
and <hi>Mollerus,</hi> and theſe he miſ-repreſents, for thus they ſpeak, <hi>Veriſimile eſt Moſen,
occaſione ab cerumnis &amp; miſeriis Iſraelitarum in deſerto ſumpta, hunc Pſalmum compoſuiſſe.</hi>
It is likely that <hi>Moſes</hi> compoſed this <hi>Pſalm</hi> upon the Occaſion of the Troubles and
Diſtreſſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Veriſimile</hi> refers to the Occaſion, not to the <hi>Pen-Man</hi> of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> but our
Candid Author leaves out the middle Words, as not to his purpoſe. Judge by this
what Credit is to be given to his Quotations.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> ſaith he, reckons this <hi>Pſalm</hi> among thoſe which had no Title ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> ſaith ſo, whom I have not by me, it's likely he ſpeaks of ſome
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlations: ſure I am, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies and the LXX. Verſion
have the ſame Title with that in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, and ſo they had in <hi>Jerom</hi>'s

Indeed ſome who allow this Title to be Authentic, conceive that <hi>David</hi> is the
Author, and that it is accomodated to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the State of the Church under him.
<hi>Theodoret</hi> mentions ſome that were of that Opinion, <hi>ſome</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do ſay, That great</hi>
David <hi>wrote it, but that he adapted it to Divine</hi> Moſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Theodor. in Pſal. 89. Secund. Gr.</note>.</p>
               <p>That which led 'em to this Error was a prevailing Opinion that all the <hi>Pſalms</hi> were
pen'd by <hi>David,</hi> which is certainly a great miſtake, <hi>2 Chron. 29. 30. Auſtin, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,
Bede,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors were of this Opinion<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Hotting. The ſaur. Philoleg.</hi> lib. 2. Sect. 3.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thus I have vindicated the Title of the <hi>90th Pſalm,</hi> againſt the Rector's trifling
Exceptions.</p>
               <p>In the next Place he Queſtions the Title of the <hi>Pſalm, 34. A</hi> Pſalm <hi>of David,
when he changed his Behaviour before</hi> Abimelech, <hi>who drove him away, and he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  <q>The King of <hi>Gath</hi> here meant is call'd <hi>Achiſh, 1 Sam.</hi> 21. 10. and not <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi>
from whence the Truth of this Title may be doubted. We are told in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that <hi>Abimelech</hi> was a common Name of the Kings of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
was of the <hi>Roman Emperours.</hi> But I am not ſatisfied with this. For I read but
of one, at moſt two ſucceſſive <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Kings of that Name, <hi>Gen. 20. and</hi> 26.
This was in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s days, but to fancy that the Name of <hi>Abimelech</hi>
was continued among the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Kings unto the days of <hi>David</hi> about eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years is not very likely, we meeting not with any one King ſo call'd in that
Interval of Time, ſave one of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael, Judg.</hi> 9. 6. nor is the <hi>Achiſh</hi>
King of <hi>Gath</hi> any where call'd <hi>Abimelech,</hi> except in this Title. That which might
give Occaſion to this Miſtake, is the mention that is made of <hi>Abimelech</hi> the High
Prieſt in <hi>1 Sam.</hi> 21. whoſe Congreſs with <hi>David</hi> takes up the nine firſt Verſes of
that Chapter.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 12, 13.</p>
               <p>To all this I anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> It was uſual in ancient Times for great Perſons to have two Names, ſo had
<hi>Shem,</hi> who according to many, is called <hi>Melchizedek</hi>
                  <note n="|" place="bottom">Light. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. p. 12.</note> So had <hi>Joſeph, Gen. 41. 45.
Jetkro</hi> is call'd <hi>Reuel, Exod.</hi> 2. 18. and 3. 1. <hi>Gideon, Jerubbaal, Judg. 7. 1. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akim</hi>
has a new Name upon his Advancement, <hi>2 Kin.</hi> 23. 34. So had <hi>Daniel</hi> and
his three Companions. It was uſual with Princes, eſpecially in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to aſſume new Names, when they enter'd upon their Government, and they
were call'd afterwards indifferently by either of both Names. Thus <hi>Achiſh</hi> ſeems
to be the Name of the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> when a private Perſon, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> a
Name he might aſſume upon his Advancement to the Throne, to conciliate the good
Will of his Subjects, for <hi>Abimelech</hi> implies that a <hi>King</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Father</hi> to his
People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly. Abimelech</hi> ſeems to have been the common Name of the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Kings
(when they had any) as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was of the Kings of <hi>Egypt, Agag</hi> of <hi>Amalek, Num.
24. 7. 1 Sam. 15. 8. Darius</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> This Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is very Ancient, how deſpicable ſoever it ſeems to the Rector, who finding it in
ſome modern Commentators in <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis,</hi> fancied they were the Authors of it.
It's mention'd by <hi>Baſil,</hi> as the received Opinion of that Age, that the Kings of the
<hi>Philiſtines</hi> were call'd by the common Name of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> tho' each of 'em had a
proper Name by which he was call'd beſides: And this Account, ſaith he, we have
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>by tradition</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Baſil. hom. in Pſal. 33. Gr. edit. Pariſ. 1618.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> But the Rector is not ſatisfied with this, becauſe he finds no one King of the
<hi>Philistines</hi> ſo call'd from <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s days unto <hi>David</hi>'s Time, for about eight hundr'd
Years. And good Reaſon for it, for he cannot find any King at all of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi>
ſo much as mention'd in all that interval of Time. We read of the Lord's of
the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> in <hi>Samſon</hi>'s Time, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 5, 30. and in the days of <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam.
5.</hi> 8. and <hi>1 Sam.</hi> 6. 4. It ſhou'd ſeem their Government was <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40622:25"/>
Nobles, as far as we have any Account of it, for the Time he mentions: And then
no wonder, he can find no King call'd <hi>Abimelech</hi> amongſt the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> In <hi>David</hi>'s
Time the ancient Government by Kings is revived, and therewith the Name of the
ancient Kings, perhaps to render the new Government more familiar to the People.
And it ſhou'd ſeem even in <hi>David</hi>'s Time, their Kings were little more than titular,
<hi>1 Sam.</hi> 29. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. But whether they had Kings or no between <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s and
<hi>David</hi>'s Time is not material to the Point in Hand; it's enough that none are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in the ſacred Hiſtory of one Name or another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> All that are acquainted with Hiſtory will own that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a common
Name of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and it is Evident from <hi>Geneſis, Exodus,</hi> i. e. two
Books of <hi>Kings,</hi> &amp;c. And yet we read of no King of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſo call'd from that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
which was drown'd in the Red Sea, unto another of the ſame Name in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Time for the ſpace of above four hundr'd Years. Does it follow therefore that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
was not a common Name of the Kings of <hi>Egypt?</hi> No more will it follow that
<hi>Abimelech</hi> was not the common Name of the Kings of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> Nothing can
be infer'd from the ſilence of Scripture Hiſtory about the Continuance of theſe two
Royal Names, for ſo long a tract of Time, for it is not the buſineſs of the <hi>Inſpired
Hiſtorians</hi> to give us the Hiſtories of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> nor are they ſo much as
mention'd but with ſome reſpect to the Church of God, whoſe Hiſtory they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly
handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> It is a very odd Conjecture of his, that <hi>Abimelech</hi> is inſerted for <hi>Abimelech</hi>
mention'd in <hi>1 Sam.</hi> 21. what an ignorant Fellow doth he make the Pen-Man of
this Title to be, that he ſhould not only miſtake <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which have no affinity either
in form or ſound, in ſubſtituting <hi>Abimelech</hi> for <hi>Abimelech,</hi> but, which is worſe, that
he ſhou'd put <hi>Abimelech</hi> the High Prieſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed
<hi>Philiſtine?</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſuch Strangers to their own Hiſtory, or

know no difference between a <hi>Holy Prieſt</hi> and a <hi>Prophane Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe ſome ignorant Hand had put <hi>Abimelech</hi> for <hi>Achiſh,</hi> as he Fancies, can
we imagine the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, to whom were <hi>Committed the Oracles of God,</hi> to be ſo

               <p>
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> Suppoſe I ſhou'd grant unto him that <hi>Abimelech</hi> is put for <hi>Abimelech,</hi> this
might be without any ſuch miſtake of <hi>Abimelech</hi> for <hi>Achiſh</hi> as he fancied, for <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi>

Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>

in <hi>1 Chron.</hi> 18. 16. and to his changing his Behaviour before <hi>Achiſh,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi>
King, for thoſe Kings were commonly call'd by the Name <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20. and 26.</p>
               <p>From the whole it appears, that his Cavils againſt the Title of the <hi>34th Pſalm,</hi>
are as groundleſs as thoſe againſt the <hi>90th Pſalm, and farther this Deponent ſaith not.</hi>
He does not pretend to except againſt any of the reſt, tho' he wou'd have all diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of the ſacred Canon.</p>
               <p>Let's now review his Argument, <q>If ſome, or if any one Title may be juſtly
Queſtion'd, then this renders all the reſt Suſpicious:</q> To which I oppoſe this, <hi>If

ſome, or if any one Title be</hi> unjuſtly <hi>Queſtion'd</hi> (as he has done thoſe of the <hi>34th</hi> and
<hi>9th Pſalm), then his Suſpicions of all the reſt are</hi> unjuſt. This Gentleman is a very

               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> His next Argument to prove the Titles a Human Addition is taken from
thoſe <q>Words tack'd to <hi>Pſalm 72. 20. the Prayers of David the Son of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
which is <hi>manifeſtly Falſe,</hi> if the Titles of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> be True, eſpecially that
of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 142. Beſides the <hi>Pſalms</hi> that follow the 72. are as truly Prayers as they
which go before it. Some body then, not inſpired, has either tranſpoſed the <hi>Pſalm</hi>
or elſe added to them the foreſaid Words, being either miſplaced or thruſt into
the Text. The like may have been done at the beginning of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> by prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and Deſires, which are <hi>Fulfilled</hi> and <hi>Conſummated</hi> in the Glory of Chriſt's Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Senſe well agrees with the ſcope of this prophetical</hi> Pſalm, <hi>eſpecially with
the foregoing Verſe,</hi> Pſalm 72. 19. let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory, Amen,
Amen. <hi>Then it follows Verſe,</hi> 20. The Prayers of <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> are ended,
or fulfilled, q. d. <hi>when this is accompliſhed,</hi> I have my Prayers fulfilled and anſwer'd.
<hi>In this Senſe the</hi> Hebrew Doctors <hi>underſtood the Place, as</hi> Muis <hi>repreſents them.</hi>
When the Meſſias comes, and the Things prophecied in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> come to paſs, then ſhall
the Prayers of <hi>David</hi> be fulfilled<note n="|" place="bottom">Cum venerit Meſſias, &amp; haec contigerint quae hoc carmine praedicuntur, enimvero tunc implebuntur Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones ſeu Vota Davidis. <hi>Muis in loc.</hi>

               <p>This is ſufficient to Vindicate this Scripture from that <hi>manifeſt Falſhood,</hi> with
which the Rector boldly Charges it. Both <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Expoſitors receive
this Verſe with the ſame Veneration as they do the reſt of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon it, inſtead of expunging it out of the Canon. It's a new way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
Difficulties and reconciling ſeeming Contrarieties, to ſay the Text is <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
Falſe.</hi> Let the World judge whether this Man be not a <hi>Corrupter of the Word
of God,</hi> who wou'd expunge a whole Verſe out of our Bibles, for no other Reaſon but
becauſe he either cou'd not reconcile it with other Scriptures, or was not willing to
have it reconciled, that he might have a colourable Argument againſt the Titles of
the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He allows in his Sermon <hi>(p. 2.)</hi> that we Corrupt the Word of God, when we
Diminſh from it: And tho' he maliciouſly Charges the whole Body of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with
Corrupting the Word of God, he has not been able to Name any one Perſon that
has Corrupted it: But I can Name unto him a Perſon that has done ſo, and that is
one Mr. <hi>Thomas Gipps,</hi> the Author of <hi>Remarks upon Remarks.</hi> The Perſon is well
known in his Countrey, tho' I can't tell whether the Rector knows him or no: This
Man I have taken <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the very Fact, Corrupting the Word of God by
Diminiſhing from it not only the <hi>Titles of the Pſalms,</hi> but a whole Verſe, <hi>e. g. Pſalm
72.</hi> 20. He can't deny the Fact, for he has publiſhed it to the World under his Hand,
he has no way by which he can hope to come off but by <hi>juſtifying what he has done,</hi>
and for that he is furniſhed with as good a Stock of <hi>Impudence</hi> as moſt Men living,
for he will not Bluſh to Affirm that ſome Things in the Bible are <hi>manifeſtly Falſe,</hi>
when it ſerve to make his Notions <hi>ſeemingly True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. But I proceed to his <hi>3d</hi> Argument againſt the Titles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There are Titles added to very many <hi>Pſalms</hi> in the LXX. Verſion, which are
not to be met with in the <hi>Hebrew, e. g. Pſalm</hi> 137. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Jeremy</hi> compoſed this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40622:26"/>
Song. I aſk then, is this Title Divinely inſpired? and yet <hi>Jerom</hi> Tranſlates and
Comments upon it.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>I Anſwers,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> The LXX. Interpreters have added and diminiſhed in abundance of Places
beſides the Titles of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> It were eaſy to give hundr'ds of Inſtances of this
kind. Nothing can be infer'd from hence but that the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters took too
Great a Liberty of varying from the Original Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> It is uncertain who compoſed the <hi>137. Pſalm,</hi> nor is it material for us to
know, while we are ſatisfied he was divinely inſpired. Some conceive it was pen'd
by <hi>David</hi> prophetically, as <hi>Iſajah</hi> wrote of the Burning of the Temple, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 11.
So did <hi>Aſaph</hi> of the Deſtruction of the City and Temple, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 79. and 74. Dr. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
is inclined to think it might be pen'd after the return from the Captivity; and
if ſo, it cou'd not be by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who was dead before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> The Addition of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was not in the Ancient Copies of the LXX, as
<hi>Hilary</hi> aſſures us, for thus he ſpeaks, <hi>It ſeem'd good to ſome to prefix the Names of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,
Haggai <hi>and</hi> Zechariah <hi>to the ſuperſcriptions of ſome</hi> Pſalms, <hi>but none of theſe
are to be found in the Authentic Copies of the LXX. Verſion</hi>

               <p>IV. His laſt Reaſon is, <q>The Oriental Verſions, the <hi>Syr. Arab.</hi> and <hi>Chaldee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe</hi>
often wants Titles, frequently change 'em, and ſometimes add Titles,
where <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> have none, which cou'd never have happen'd, if they
had been Canonical Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> on the <hi>Pentatuch</hi> by <hi>Onkelos,</hi> and that on the <hi>Prophets</hi> by
<hi>Jonathan,</hi> which are thought to be written about the Times of Chriſt, are not of
that Authority as to bring the <hi>Hebrew Copy</hi> in queſtion, where they differ from it.
I confeſs they have their Uſe, both for confirming the Purity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text,
as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and the Illuſtration of it, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8. but eſpecially in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> where they bear Teſtimony to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as in <hi>Gen. 49.
10. Iſa.</hi> 45. 17, &amp;c. but where they differ from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> (as they do in a
great many Places) we ought to prefer the Fountain before the Streams. In the
more obſcure Places they follow the LXX. Verſion, as <hi>Munſter</hi> obſerves<note n="†" place="bottom">Praefat in Jonam.</note>, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can be of no greater Authority than the LXX. They are not without ſome <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh</hi>
Fables, as in <hi>Num.</hi> 21. 19. In ſome Places they depart from the Fountain of
Truth, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, as in <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 3. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 28. and 28. 64. where
it is foretold that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhou'd <hi>ſerve other Gods,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the Guilt of this upon the Heathen. A great deal of this Nature will occur
to the obſervant Reader.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Targum,</hi> or <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> on the <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> among which the <hi>Jews</hi> reckon'd
the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> was made about the Year of Chriſt, 600, and is of leſs Authority than
the two Former. This alſo varies from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text in multitudes of Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Titles of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Syriac,</hi> which is Ancient, tho' in many Places it follows the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet in
others it differs from it, in ſeveral of which it follows the LXX.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arabic</hi> Verſion generally follows the <hi>Syriac</hi>
                  <note n="|" place="bottom">Prolegom. in Pol. Synop.</note>, and therefore deſerves no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
conſideration.</p>
               <p>So that this Argument of the Rector proves nothing in Prejudice of the Titles
of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> without affecting other Parts of Scripture, which are differently
rendred in the <hi>Oriental Verſions.</hi> Thus our Author by attempting to deſtroy the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of <hi>Pſalm,</hi> has produced an Argument which equally depreciates the Authority
of moſt, if not all the Books of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Theodoret</hi> Cenſures ſome who
thought the <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> to be Falſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. And adds, <hi>To me it ſeems great Raſhneſs to alter the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40622:27"/>
which were in being in the Time of</hi> Ptolomy, <hi>who reigned in</hi> Egypt <hi>after</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,

               <p>The Rector adds, <q>that there is not one Title in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> which is at all uſeful
to the unfolding any Myſteries relating to Jeſus Chriſt. p. 15.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is confidently ſpoken after his Manner, but the Ancient Fathers were of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

               <p>Had the Rector been as converſant with Jeſus Chriſt, as the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> were,
he might have found him even in the <hi>Titles</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others of them direct us to the Author, Occaſion, Intention and Uſe of the
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> which greatly contribute to the right Underſtanding of it. Some others
refer to the Meter and Inſtruments, on which they were to be Sung: Theſe the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors confeſs their Ignorance of. But it does not follow, if ſome of them
be unintelligible to us, that all ought to be expung'd out of the Canon. There are
ſeveral other Things in the Holy Scripture hard to be underſtood, which muſt not
therefore be rejected: And many of the Titles are eaſy and plain, and are therefore
Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Titles are <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Eſſential</hi> Parts of Scriptures, as I have clearly
proved, the Rector is yet to Account, why they are left out of the <hi>Liturgy-Pſalms,</hi>
and why a more imperfect Verſion of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> comes to be prefer'd to the more
Correct, which came out in King <hi>James</hi> the I. his Time. The new Tranſlation
which is in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, and has the Titles, is never read in the Congregation;
and the old imperfect Tranſlation, which varies in ſeveral Places from it, and in ſome
is contrary to it (as in <hi>Pſalm 105. 28.)</hi> is conſtantly uſed in our publick Aſſemblies.
And it is more unaccountable yet, that we muſt give our <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> to the
unperfect Tranſlation, when we have a better in our Bibles: Theſe are Myſteries
the Rector is perhaps better able to unfold, than he is the Myſteries concerning Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt in the Titles of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He aſk'd us in his Sermon, <hi>why they are not done into</hi> Engliſh? I anſwer'd, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
could beſt reſolve the Queſtion, whoſe Tranſlation we Uſe. The Rector is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40622:27"/>
with this Conceſſion of Mind, and wiſhes the Diſſenters to take Notice, <q>That
the Scriptures being in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue is owing to the Biſhops Labours, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Piety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We think not the worſe of any good Thing, becauſe it comes to us through the
Hands of the Biſhops, for whoſe Learning and Piety we have a juſt Eſteem: And
yet as to this Point I muſt crave his Pardon for that ſlip of my Pen, in calling the
preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſion, the <hi>Biſhops Tranſlation,</hi> for I don't find one Biſhop among
the XLVII. Tranſlators nominated by King <hi>James</hi> the I. It's True, ſome were
made Biſhops afterwards, and it's as True, that ſome others, as Mr. <hi>Lively,</hi> Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
&amp;c. Had no great Zeal for impoſed Ceremonies. Several of them were fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

In their Inſtructions they were to uſe <hi>Tindals, Matthews,</hi> the <hi>Geneva,</hi> &amp;c. Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

               <p>
                  <q>But, ſaith he, the Diſſenters leave the Titles out of their <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Meter,
nor do they Sing 'em.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It's very True, nor were they deſign'd to be Sung, as all will Acknowledge, and
it's Plain that ſome of 'em are Directions about the Manner of Singing, which the
<hi>Jews</hi> themſelves are Ignorant of. But it does not follow that becauſe they
are left out of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in <hi>Meter,</hi> that they ought to be left out in the <hi>Proſe</hi>
alſo? Many Paſſages of Scripture are improper to be Sung, muſt we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
read them? And I am apt to think the Reaſon why they were left out
of the Liturgy-Pſalms was becauſe they were intended to be Sung, as they
are ſtill in <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> and the <hi>Rubrick</hi> allows it in Pariſh Churches: Now ſince the
<hi>Pſalms</hi> are <hi>Read</hi> and not <hi>Sung</hi> in our <hi>Parochial Aſſemblies,</hi> the Titles which are Part
of Scripture, ought not to be expung'd out of the reading Pſalter. They can't be
well Sung, nor were deſign'd for that End, and therefore are left out of the Singing
Pſalms; but they may and ought to be read, as Part of the Word of God, and
therefore ſhou'd not be left out of the reading Pſalms. But this is not the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
between me and the Rector. The not reading of 'em is an <hi>innocent Omiſſion,</hi>
but the Rector's <hi>Attempt</hi> of thruſting 'em out of the Holy Canon is vile and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.</p>

of God. He owns himſelf <hi>in a Heat,</hi> Serm, p. 27. and then he was at Liberty <hi>to ſay

St. <hi>Luke</hi> was, and the Gentiles had no way to examine the truth of his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
out of the Old Teſtament, but by comparing 'em with their <hi>Greek</hi> Bibles.
He was neither known nor eſteemed by the generality of the Gentiles, until his
Writings made him ſo, which were the more eſteemed for their agreement with
that Verſion of the Old Teſtament which they had among them. Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi>
ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe with <hi>Jerome. Whereas the New Teſtament was to
be wrote in</hi> Greek, <hi>and come into the hands chiefly of the Gentiles, it was moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,

               <p>
                  <hi>Jerome</hi> doth not ſay, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> was <hi>vilus &amp; non magnae fidei,</hi> but <hi>ducebatur,</hi> he
was ſo accounted in the Nations, who at that time were ſtrangers to him, and had
a greater Veneration for the Lxx than for his Writings. And if the Gentiles
eſteemed him <hi>ignotus &amp; vilis,</hi> it was no more than as the <hi>Athenians</hi> eſteem'd St.
<hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17. 18. The Rector may as well condemn St. <hi>Luke</hi> for ſaying that St.

Since the Rector excepts againſt <hi>Jerome</hi> as a Man <hi>unworthy to be believed in any

in the Fourteenth Pſalm in <hi>Origen</hi>'s time, who lived above an Age before <hi>Jerome</hi>
was known in the World. And this Teſtimony is the more conſiderable, becauſe
<hi>Origen</hi> had a genuine Copy of the Lxx, which he exhibited in his <hi>Hexapla,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

               <p>This is the Verſion to which <hi>Jerome</hi> appeal'd, and of which he affirms, that it

in the <hi>Eaſtern Churches,</hi> and at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was but 35 Furlongs, or about 4
Miles 1/2 diſtant from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where <hi>Jerome</hi> lived <hi>(Juſt. Mart. Apol. 2.)</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any body might eaſily diſprove him, had he miſ-repreſented matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>Now let any Man judge what an indecent thing it is in our Rector to blacken
<hi>Jerome</hi>'s Memory with the Imputation of the moſt impudent and moſt fooliſh Lie,
which Thouſands of that Age could have detected, and he wanted not Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
that would have ſufficiently expoſed him upon ſuch an occaſion. His Friend
<hi>Rufinus</hi> would have aggravated a Crime of this Nature, and made the World
ſenſible of it long ago.</p>
               <p>But whence is all this Spite at poor <hi>Jerome?</hi> The Rector is a Man that cannot
ſuppreſs (tho' he endeavours it) the reaſons of his Reſentments. He calls <hi>Jerome,</hi>
before he was aware, the <hi>Presbyterian Father.</hi> Theſe <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are a ſad ſort of
People, the very mention of their Name puts the Rector into a <hi>viſible Diſorder,</hi>
and raiſes ſuch a Commotion in his Spirits, as if he were haunted by a Legion of
<hi>Presbyterian Ghoſts.</hi> His hatred to them is ſuch, that he cannot forbear <hi>ſpitting
his Venome</hi> at every body that ſeems to favour their Principles.</p>
               <p>This is Father <hi>Jerome</hi>'s fault, which the Rector cannot forgive him. He hath
prov'd Biſhops and Presbyters were one and the ſame in the Apoſtles times, and
that the difference between them was by <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cuſtom,</hi> and not by <hi>Divine

               <p>
                  <hi>He is very angry with me</hi> (p. 19.) For endeavouring to make my Party believe he
deſigned to depreſs the Authority of the Hebrew Copies. Surely, this Miniſter, <hi>ſaith
he,</hi> never conſiders what he writes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's well if the Rector conſiders</hi> what he does, <hi>in giving occaſion to this Charge,
which I ſhall abundantly confirm. He ſaith in his Sermon,</hi> p. 9. That it is more
probable the Three controverted Verſes might be left out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, by the
careleſneſs of the Tranſcribers, than thruſt into the <hi>Greek</hi> by Tranſlators.</p>
               <p>Here he evidently depreſſeth the Authority of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the Lxx before them: Nay, By this Rule we muſt receive all the <hi>Additions</hi>
of the Lxx (which are exceeding many) as Canonical, and ſuppoſe 'em left out
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies by the careleſneſs of the Tranſcribers, <hi>e. g.</hi> they add a
whole Pſalm at the end of the Pſalm about <hi>David's Victory over Goliah:</hi> They

at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> that they were laid up in <hi>Timnath-Serah,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s
Grave, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21. 42. and 24. 30. They add to <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 10. Inſtead of <hi>they ſaw
the God of Iſrael,</hi> they read, <hi>they ſaw the place where God ſtood.</hi> They add a
whole Paragraph at the end of <hi>Joſhua, Joſhua</hi> 24. 33. They have a long Verſe
in <hi>Job</hi> 1. 9. in which they repreſent <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife <hi>ſcolding</hi> at her Husband. They
add to the end of <hi>Job</hi> 42. 17.</p>
               <p>I cou'd inſtance in ſome Hundreds of <hi>Additions</hi> to, and <hi>Variations</hi> from the
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. Now all theſe muſt be admitted to the prejudice of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy, and of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles (which have 'em not) according to
the Rector's way of reaſoning.</p>
               <p>The Rector obſtinately aſſerts the Authority of the Lxx, <hi>which he is inclin'd
to believe to be divine; vindicates</hi> the <hi>additional Verſes</hi> in the fourteenth <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
againſt the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles that have them not; profeſſedely charges our <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Text with ſeveral <hi>Corruptions,</hi> and thoſe <hi>in things very material</hi> (which I ſhall
conſider preſently) and yet confidently tells us, <hi>'twas never in his thoughts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the</hi> Hebrew, <hi>p.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Sure the Rector does not expect to be believ'd in what he ſays. If charging
the Bible with <hi>groſs Corruptions</hi> be not a depreſſing of it, what is? He wou'd
have <hi>it burnt</hi> for one Corruption, and yet the charging it with many Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is no <hi>depreſſion</hi> to it. We will ſuppoſe the Rector at this time had an eye
to the <hi>Presbyterian Father,</hi> and <hi>did not care what he ſaid or wrote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I told him,</hi> If the <hi>Lxx</hi> be of as good Authority as the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> it's uncertain what
becomes of the Rector's Text, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 6. for it is not in my Edition of the <hi>Lxx.

               <p>Here he <hi>mightily triumphs</hi> that he has found his Text in the Lxx, and <hi>(p.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are words of Courſe with the Rector, and ſignifie no more than that he
is a Man of <hi>good breeding,</hi> and has a <hi>Sett of mannerly expreſſions,</hi> with which he
accommodates <hi>his friends</hi> upon all Occaſions.</p>
               <p>It's true, the Text is in the Lxx, but not in its proper place. I look'd into
the end of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> where it ought to be, and not finding it there, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it was not in my <hi>Septuagint Bible.</hi> I have met with it ſince in <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. incerted

the Lxx (which are of <hi>divine Authority</hi> to the Rector) are very imperfect, and
may ground a Conjecture, that theſe Verſes were thruſt into that place by ſome
ignorant hand, which has made bold with the Lxx in abundance of other places.
I find them miſ-placed not only in the <hi>Roman,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Copy.</p>
               <p>Its being rightly placed in the <hi>Complutenſian</hi> and <hi>Frankford</hi> Editions which the

               <p>It will not be much for the Rector's Reputation to lick up <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s Spittle, whoſe
Judgment bore no proportion to his great reading, as may appear by the following
Paſſages, which I ſhall tranſcribe out of him.</p>
               <p>That Book, <hi>ſaith he, of the Hebrew Bible,</hi> is dumb, which no man is able to read or
underſtand, becauſe one half of it is maimed; neither has it any Vowels, but what were
given it by the enemies of Chriſtianity<note n="*" place="bottom">Codex ille mutus eſt, quem nec legere, ne dum intelligere, quiſquam ſciat. <hi>Iſ. Voſ. Reſp. ad Nup. Crit.</hi>

               <p>In another place he paſſes this arrogant Cenſure on the Learned Tranſlators of
the Hebrew Bible.</p>
               <p>I could produce <hi>whole Chapters,</hi> eſpecially out of the more obſcure Books of the Holy
Scripture, as <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Job, Hoſhea,</hi> and others, in which you will not find ſo much
as <hi>one Verſe</hi> rightly underſtood, and rendred by the Interpreters of our Age<note n="|" place="bottom">In quibus ne unicus quidem occurrat verſiculus, qui à noſtri ſaeculi Interpretibus rectè acceptus &amp; redditus fuerit. <hi>De Sibyll. Orac. cap. 13. p.</hi> 270.</note>.</p>
               <p>If no Man be able to read or underſtand the <hi>Hebrew Bible,</hi> how comes <hi>Voſſius</hi>
to underſtand it? And if he does not underſtand it, how knows he that the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters

had he not given us a right Tranſlation of thoſe <hi>whole Chapters</hi> that are miſren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He repeats his bold Aſſertion,</hi> The Hebrew Book is mute, as being deſtitute of true
Vowels, and tho' we had Vowels, even this would not enable us to Tranſlate it, ſince we
have utterly loſt the ſignification of the words, and the ſenſe which ariſes from them;
even the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves do not deny this difficulty of interpreting. <hi>Reſp. ad Obj. p.</hi> 325.</p>

               <head type="sub">Being a Vindication of my Arguments for the Purity of the Hebrew Text.</head>
               <p>I Briefly hinted at two or three Arguments for the Purity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies,
which. I will now improve and vindicate from the Rector's Exceptions.</p>
               <p>I. I affirm'd the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies to have been incorrupt in our Saviour's Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he <hi>never Charg'd the</hi> Jews <hi>with Corrupting the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rector takes no Notice of this Argument, but he ſaith afterwards <hi>(p. 22.)</hi>
                  <q>many Corruptions <hi>might ſteal</hi> into the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and <hi>deſignedly be thruſt</hi> into it
before Chriſts Time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He dare not ſay, there were any thruſt into it, but he ſlily inſinuates there <hi>might
be:</hi> He deals here with the ſacred Text, as he has done with Diſſenters, he brings
it <hi>under Suſpicion,</hi> when he wants direct Proof.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Jews</hi> before the Birth of Chriſt had deſignedly Corrupted the Holy Bible,
doubtleſs we ſhou'd have heard of it in the Hiſtory of the New Teſtament. We
are told there that the <hi>Oracles of God were Committed to them,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. They
were made the <hi>Conſervators</hi> of the Divine Writings, which were concredited to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40622:31"/>
Had they betray'd ſo great a Truſt, and perfidiouſly falſified the Holy Scriptures,
can we imagine that Chriſt and his Apoſtles wou'd have overlook'd ſo horrid a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
attended with a train of the moſt fatal Conſequences? Jeſus Chriſt was
faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> was in all his Houſe: <hi>Moſes</hi> as a
Servant, but Chriſt as a Son over his own Houſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> his Fidelity conſiſted in
his Care to tranſmit the Divine Laws pure and incorrupt to the People as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them in the Mount: Had theſe Laws been Corrupted by the wickedneſs of
after Ages, doubtleſs the Lord Jeſus wou'd have reſtored 'em to their Original Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
It cannot be conceiv'd that the Son ſhou'd be leſs concern'd for the Laws of
his Houſe than the Servant had been. One great end of his Appearance was to
Reform the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and wou'd he leave their very Laws
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nteform'd?</hi> He came into the World <hi>to bear Witneſs unto the Truth,</hi> and can we think
he wou'd have overlook'd the <hi>Falſhoods</hi> of that Book which is the <hi>Standard of Truth,</hi>
had any been <hi>thruſt into it,</hi> as the Rector ſuppoſes? He who reproves the <hi>Jews</hi> for
leſſer Sins, wou'd never have Connived at ſo great an Abomination, as the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the <hi>Hebrew Copies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He cenſures their <hi>Corrupt Gloſſes</hi> upon the Law, and Vindicates it from them. <hi>Mat.
5.</hi> much more wou'd he have noted the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the Original Text.</p>
               <p>He bids his Diſciples <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, hear the Scribes and Phariſees ſitting in
the Seat of</hi> Moſes, <hi>who was read in the</hi> Synagogues <hi>every Sabbath day.</hi> It's not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he wou'd have recommended the Study of <hi>corrupted and depraved Scriptures</hi>
unto his Followers without a <hi>neceſſary Caution</hi> againſt the Errors of them.</p>
               <p>From the whole it's Evident that the Scripture of the Old Teſtament was not
Corrupted before the Birth of Chriſt, nor were they Corrupted after, as appears by
the Teſtimonies which Chriſt and his Apoſtles cite out of 'em, which are all for
Subſtance to be found in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as they are cited by them.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> anciently argued for the Purity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, <q>If
the <hi>Jews</hi> Corrupted the Scriptures (ſay they), they did it either before or ſince
the coming of Chriſt: Not before, becauſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles do not Charge
'em with it; not after, becauſe the Allegations made by Chriſt and his Apoſtles out
of the Old Teſtament are all, or moſt of 'em ſtill to be found there<note n="*" place="bottom">Orig. lib. 8. in Iſa. ut refert Hieron. in Cap. 6. Iſa.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>II. I urged the Teſtimony of <hi>Philo,</hi> who flouriſhed about the XLth. Year of Chriſt:
He writes that even unto his Time for the ſpace of above 2000 Years, not <hi>one
Word</hi> had been Chang'd in the Writings of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the Rector anſwers, <q>that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which I render'd <hi>Word,</hi> ſometimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<hi>Sentence,</hi> or an <hi>intire Propoſition.</hi> 'Twas the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were
careful of, and not the Words, Syllables or Letters, according to <hi>Philo</hi> in this
Place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſually render'd <hi>Word</hi> by all Interpreters, and that's the Primary and
moſt proper Signification of it, and any one wou'd ſo render it here that has no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to expoſe the Scripture, and does not ſtudy to elude ſuch plain Teſtimonies as
aſſert it's Purity. He grants that the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to <hi>Philo,</hi> changed not any
<hi>Sentence</hi> of the Law: But who knows not that the change of one Word, yea of one
Letter (as in the inſtance of <hi>ye</hi> and <hi>we)</hi> often alters a whole Sentence? If Words
might be chang'd, whole Sentences might as eaſily be perverted. <hi>Philo</hi> argues <hi>a
minore ad majus,</hi> that the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo far from changing the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—<hi>that they removed,</hi> or
changed <hi>not one Word of what he had written.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rector prevaricates when he ſaith, <hi>'twas the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>they were careful
of, and not the Words:</hi> Doubtleſs they were careful of both, and <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith, they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40622:31"/>
changed not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>not one Word,</hi> with what confidence then dare the Rector
affirm <hi>they were not careful of the Words?</hi> He confeſſes <hi>they were careful of the Laws,</hi>
he wou'd do well to tell us how the Laws cou'd be preſerv'd without the Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It does not follow hence ſaith he, that there was no Alteration in any Word or
Point; this might happen <hi>(tho' the</hi> Jews <hi>did it not wilfully)</hi> for any thing <hi>Philo</hi>
offers to the contrary.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>Truth is conſtant to it ſelf, but the Rectors notions are inconſiſtent: He told us
above <hi>that many Corruptions might be deſignedly thruſt into the Text before Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Time,</hi>
and now he ſaith, <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>alter'd not a Word wilfully.</hi> This he delivers as his own
Senſe in a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> and not as <hi>Philo</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>It's evident the Rector ſtrains the Signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to elude the Force of
<hi>Philo</hi>'s Teſtimony for the Purity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. It's true it ſignifies a <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>
ſometimes, but we ought not to recede from the primary and literal Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Words without neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were careful not only of the Sentences, but <hi>were Religious to Superſtition
in counting the very Letters of the Bible to preſerve it intire,</hi> as the Rector told us in
his <hi>Sermon,</hi> p. 13. but now he is inclined to think they took no Care of the <hi>Words,
Syllables</hi> or <hi>Letters,</hi> but only of the Sentences of the Law, as he explains <hi>Philo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I leave it to ſuch as can to reconcile the Rector to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had of Old, and ſtill have, ſuch a Zeal for their Law,
that the very <hi>Words, Syllables</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> were preſerved by them with no leſs Care
than the <hi>Sentences</hi> of the Law.</p>
               <p>We have a memorable Story in <hi>Jerome,</hi> which whether True or Falſe ſhews what
a Zeal the <hi>Jews</hi> of that Age had for the Words and Letters of the Law. The Story
is this. <hi>Joab</hi> ſlew his Maſter, becauſe he did the Work of the Lord deceitfully,

the ſame in both readings, all the difference lies in the Points or Vowels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Jewiſh Rabbies <hi>ſay,</hi> that he who makes the leaſt Alteration in the Bible commits the
inexpiable Sin: <hi>And they add,</hi> that if any One out of Ignorance, or Malice ſhou'd change
<hi>One Word</hi> therein, the whole World wou'd be in danger of Periſhing, and returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it's primitive Chaos: <hi>And they give this Reaſon for their Opinion (which they
endeavour various ways to confirm)</hi> that the World was Created for the Sake of the
Holy Scripture: If any one therefore ſhou'd Corrupt the Scripture, the World must needs

               <p>This Confirms <hi>Philo</hi>'s Teſtimony, and explains the meaning of his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which the Rector has weakly endeavour'd to perplex: But I ſhall have Occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to ſpeak more of their Care of the very <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> of the Law, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to this Teſtimony of <hi>Philo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. I argued from the <hi>Maſora,</hi> which I affirm'd to have been a effectual means
to preſerve the Purity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and renders it impoſſible that any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
ſhou'd have crept into them.</p>
               <p>All that the Rector hath to ſay to this Argument is, <q>That 'twas no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for cunning <hi>Rabbies</hi> to alter Words and Letters, and ſtill to keep the juſt
Number of them, as <hi>ye</hi> and <hi>we</hi> in <hi>Acts.</hi> 6. 3. where ſtill remains the ſame Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Words and Letters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Rector diſcovers himſelf to be a perfect Stranger to the <hi>Maſora,</hi> which tells
us not how many <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> are in every Book, but the Genuine <hi>Writing</hi> and
<hi>Reading,</hi> where any diverſity Occurs, as alſo when Words are written <hi>Fully</hi> with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40622:32"/>
quieſcent Letters, eſpecially <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and when <hi>defectively</hi> without them: They
note when a Word <hi>begins, ends,</hi> or is to be found in the <hi>Middle</hi> of a Verſe: They
obſerve all the <hi>peculiar Conſtructions</hi> of it, with the <hi>Ambiguous Significations;</hi> they
remark alſo the <hi>Vowels</hi> and <hi>Accents:</hi> They take notice of the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and of thoſe that are <hi>inverted</hi> and <hi>ſymbolically</hi> Pointed; nay they have enter'd
down how often every Letter of the Alphabet is contain'd in the whole Scripture.
All this and much more the learned Reader may find in <hi>Buxtorf</hi>'s <hi>Tiberias</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
upon the Maſora,</hi> by which it's Evident the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies could not be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
after the <hi>Maſora</hi> was Written. This is acknowledged both by <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> that underſtand the <hi>Maſora.</hi>

the Time of the</hi> Maſora <hi>(which he thinks was invented at</hi> Tiberias <hi>after the
Year 500.) yet he owns it in concurrence with other</hi> Rabbies <hi>to be an</hi> effectual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatory

it was not Corrupted ſince the Invention of the <hi>Maſora,</hi> and therefore have
no way to avoid this Argument but by affirming (with <hi>Elias Levita)</hi> that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora</hi>
is a late Invention of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Tiberias,</hi> about the Year 500; and that the
Scripture was Corrupted either before or by thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who drew up the <hi>Maſoretick</hi>
Notes and invented the Vowels. This way the Popiſh Doctors and <hi>Voſſius</hi> go. But
the Rector deſerting his learned Friends, ignorantly affirms the <hi>Maſora</hi> cou'd not
preſerve the Bibles in Purity. He is willing to believe they are Corrupted, and that
no Art or Care of Man (no not the admirable Invention of the <hi>Maſora)</hi> could
poſſibly prevent it.</p>
               <p>However, he is ſo kind to us, as to tell us, <q>That he does not affirm, that the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> was Corrupted in any material Thing till after the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p>He ſhou'd have informed us, what <hi>immaterial Corruptions</hi> were got into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and what <hi>material Ones</hi> after.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Nevertheleſs, adds he, it might have been Corrupted before the <hi>Fifth Century,</hi>

                  <hi>Rem.</hi> ibid.</p>
               <p>Here he ſeems to allow that the Bible has not been Corrupted (at leaſt in any
Thing that is <hi>Material)</hi> after the penning of the <hi>Maſora</hi> in the <hi>Fourth Century.</hi> He
wou'd or ſhou'd have ſaid the <hi>Sixth Century,</hi> for the <hi>Maſora,</hi> according to <hi>Elias Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>

the Birth of Chriſt, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>were Religious to Superſtition, as may
be thought, counting the very Letters of the Bible to preſerve it intire: Hereunto our Lord
alludes, in</hi> Matt. 5. 18.</p>
               <p>Our Author is ſo variable, that one knows not where to find him.</p>

One while the <hi>Maſora</hi> was before the Birth of Chriſt <hi>(i. e.</hi> Since <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Time)
another while it was invented in the <hi>Fifth Century.</hi> In one Humour he wou'd have
us believe the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>Religious to Superſtition,</hi> to preſerve the Bible intire; in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Humour, they <hi>deſignedly Corrupted</hi> it; in another Mood, <hi>they alter'd not a
Word willfully.</hi> The Rector ſhou'd blame no Body for differing from him, ſince he
can't agree with himſelf.</p>
               <p>Conveniet nulli qui ſecum diſſidet ipſe.</p>
               <p>He gravely <q>concludes, 'tis but lately ſince the Chriſtians receiv'd the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Bible from the modern <hi>Jews,</hi> who may very well be ſuſpected to have made bold
with it in prejudice to the Chriſtian Religion.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Had the Chriſtians no <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles till of late Years? Were there not <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Bibles in the Hands of the Ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> who many of 'em became Chriſtians? The
Apoſtles were <hi>Jews,</hi> I hope he'l not ſay they had no <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles, or that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them of the <hi>modern Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But perhaps he means the preſent Copies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, and that theſe
are come from the modern <hi>Jews.</hi> This is boldly affirm'd, and if we call upon him
to prove it, he muſt have recourſe to <hi>F. Simons</hi> help, who tho' he has endeavour'd
to weaken the Authority of our <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles, yet is forced to Confeſs the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the Copy that goes under <hi>R. Hillel</hi>'s Name, which the <hi>Jews</hi> affirm to be
Written by <hi>R. Hillel</hi> himſelf, ſome Years before the Birth of Chriſt. So doth <hi>Cunae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
de Repub. Hebr.</hi> and <hi>Schickard de jure Reg. Hebr.</hi> who are quoted by <hi>F. Simon,</hi>
but he himſelf thinks it was Written by ſome <hi>Jewiſh Rabbi</hi> of that Name ſince the
Invention of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Points by the Doctors of the School of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> becauſe
he finds it Pointed and Accented. So that according to his Confeſſion it may be above
1000. Years Old: And if the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Vowels be Co-equal with the Letters (as I
think the Judicious and Learned <hi>Buxtrof</hi> hath effectually prov'd) the <hi>Hillelian</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
with which our modern Copies agree, may be as Old as the <hi>Jews</hi> affirm, and
written by the Ancient and Famous <hi>Hillel,</hi> who flouriſhed about 60. Years before
the Birth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs there are many Ancient Copies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible in ſeveral <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Libraries,</hi> for which we are not obliged to the modern <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſaith he ſaw ſeven hundr'd Manuſcript Copies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Bible in one Library. The Rector perhaps can tell what <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors they were
borrow'd of.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe our preſent <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies had come from the modern <hi>Jews,</hi> it
does not follow <hi>they made bold with them in Prejudice to Chriſtianity,</hi> as the Rector <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</hi>
This ſuſpicious Gentleman ought to ſhew us wherein they have Corrupted
them.</p>
               <p>Had they falſified the Scripture in Prejudice of Chriſtianity, doubtleſs they would
have expung'd the Chief Prophecies concerning Jeſus Chriſt: But that they have
not done, for thoſe Places wherein the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Bibles differ from the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
ſeldom concern the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies do often make
more againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> than the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Verſions; as for inſtance, in <hi>Pſalm,
2. 12. receive diſcipline,</hi> ſo the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> from which nothing can be directly

                  <hi>kiſs the Son,</hi> is an invincible
Argument againſt them. Have the <hi>Jews</hi> Corrupted their Copies that they might
give a more expreſs Teſtimony to the <hi>Son of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies are not depraved by the modern <hi>Jews</hi> is evident from
their Agreement with thoſe which <hi>Jerom</hi> uſed. It's apparent to any one that will
be at the Pains to compare them, that wherein our Copies differ from the LXX,
they generally agree with that which <hi>Jerom</hi> uſed, as far as we have any Account
of it in his Writings.</p>
               <p>The Learned <hi>Salomon Glaſſius,</hi> Profeſſor of the Holy Tongues at <hi>Jena,</hi> ſpeaks of
a very Ancient Manuſcript of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible in their Colledge, curiouſly Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40622:33"/>
in Royal Parchment. This he carefully examin'd for the greateſt Part, and
could not obſerve it to vary from other Copies in the leaſt tittle, but that ſome
Words were omitted at the firſt writing, which upon the review were ſupplied<note n="*" place="bottom">—Ne punctulo quidem à Codicibus aliis diſcrepare, animadvertere potui. <hi>Philol. Sacrae lib. 1. tract. 1. p.</hi> 23.</note>.</p>
               <p>IV. I will add one other Argument for the Purity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. If the
<hi>Jews</hi> neither cou'd nor wou'd have Corrupted the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, it follows that
they have not Corrupted them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> They cou'd not Corrupt all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, if they had been never ſo
deſirous, for there was a pure Copy in every Synagog in the World beſides thoſe in
the Hands of Chriſtians. Now, is it poſſible that ſo many Copies in diſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Places ſhou'd be all Corrupted, and not one left to detect the Fraud? It
is very abſur'd to fancy a general Conſpiracy between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors to falſify
all their Bibles, and that in ſuch Texts where they had no Intereſt to ſerve, and in
the mean Time to leave the great Prophecies concerning Jeſus Chriſt untouch'd?
Had ſuch a piece of Villany been attempted, I doubt not but the World had rung of
it long ago. That watchful Providence which hath preſerv'd the Holy Scriptures
from the deſtructive Rage of Perſecutors, and the corrupting Attempts of cunning
Hereticks,<note n="†" place="bottom">Niceph. Eccl. hiſt. <hi>IV.</hi> 21.</note> wou'd doubtleſs have raiſed up ſome Inſtruments to aſſert the Purity of
the Divine Law; nay rather than ſo helliſh a Combination ſhou'd take Effect, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
not but among the very Actors themſelves ſome wou'd have been influenced
by the ſovereign Director of humane Intellects, to detect and oppoſe ſo Vile a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
To phancy ſuch an univerſal Corruption of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, is to dream
that the World is govern'd without a Providence, and that the chiefeſt Objects of
it's peculiar Care, the <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> are left in the Power of reſtleſs and
malicious Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Juſtin Martyr <hi>takes notice of the providential Care of Heaven in preſerving the
Holy Bible in the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Synagogues for the Uſe of the Chriſtian Church.</hi> It muſt
be aſſigned to the Divine Providence, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> that our Religion is at this Day preſerved
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom becauſe we wou'd not give Occaſion to reproach us by Producing
the Scriptures out of our Church, we chuſe rather to produce 'em out of the Synagogue, of

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> uſed the greateſt Care and Caution imaginable in Tranſcribing the
Law. They examin'd all Copies with a moſt Religious diligence. If there were
but two or three Faults in every Leaf, one may mend and read them in Private, ſay
the <hi>Maſters,</hi> but if there were more Faults, ſuch a Bible was not allow'd for private
Uſe. <hi>Li. ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In every Synagogue they had a true Copy, and it was their Care every where to
have their Bible as purely Authentick as poſſible, as may be ſeen by the curious
Rules that are given to that purpoſe in <hi>Maſſech. Sopherim,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far Dr. <hi>Lightf.</hi> in
whom you may ſee much more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The modern <hi>Jews</hi> retain the Zeal of their Anceſtors for the Purity of the Divine
Law, <hi>Rom. 10. 2. Act.</hi> 21. 20. They have the moſt Religious regard to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they never put it in an unclean Place, nor touch it with defiled Hands, and if
it happens to touch the Ground; they keep a publick Faſt, to obviate the Judgment
which ſuch an Accident portends.</p>
               <p>If a Copy had but one Corruption, it was not admitted into the Synagog, but
to be buried in an Earthen Veſſel, and never to be uſed, but in extreme Neceſſity a
poor Man might teach his Children to read in it, but muſt not bring it into the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagog,
nor apply it to any other Uſe. To this unparallelled Vigilancy and Care is
owing the perfect Harmony and ſurprizing Conſent of the Manuſcript Copies of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible throughout the World at this Day. No one Copy, written by a <hi>Jew,</hi>
can be produced (as learned <hi>Hebricians</hi> have affirm'd) that has the leaſt diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>I. His firſt Exception to the Purity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is taken out of <hi>Juſt. Martyn,</hi>
who charg'd <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>with Corrupting the Scriptures.</hi> To this I anſwer'd, with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the</hi> Greek, <hi>but not the</hi> Hebrew. For this the Rector very ſcornfully demands
my <hi>Reaſon.</hi> p. 24.</p>
               <p>My reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Juſt. Mart.</hi> expreſly mentions their Corrupting the Lxx, and

out of the <hi>Tranſlation of the Elders</hi> that were with <hi>Ptolomy</hi> many intire Texts, in which
is clearly foretold that this Crucified one ſhou'd be God and Man, and that he muſt be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>II. <q>The paſſages objected by <hi>Juſtin</hi> (as the Rector adds) are ſtill wanting in
our <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles, for inſtance, <hi>Pſalm, 96. 10. ſay among</hi> the Heathen the Lord
hath reigned, but <hi>Juſtin</hi> tells <hi>Trypho</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> had been ſtruck out by the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and that the Place ſhou'd run thus, <hi>the Lord hath reigned from the Wood</hi> or
Croſs. Theſe Words, <hi>from the Croſs,</hi> are not in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or Lxx. at this Day.
The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy in <hi>Jerom</hi>'s days wanted the ſame Words, and they are to be
found in <hi>Auſtin, Cyprian, Tertull.</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Flam. Nobilius</hi> aſſitms.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Here the Rector advances a bold Charge againſt the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at leaſt to the Corrupting of God's Word, and that in an illuſtrious Prediction
of the Manner of Chriſts Death, whom they had ſo little a regard to (according
to the Charitable Rector) as to neglect the reſtoring ſo famous a Prophecy to it's
due Place in the Bible, and that after they were told of the Corruption of <hi>Juſt.
Martyr.</hi> This is a very ſevere Charge againſt the <hi>whole Generation of the Righteous.</hi>
You ſee the Diſſenters have a great deal of good Company that ſuffer with them
under the Rector's unjuſt Criminations of being Corrupters of the Word of
God.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed that <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Copy of the Lxx. had the Words, <hi>from the Wood,</hi>
and this was follow'd by ſome of the Fathers, but the more Correct Copies had 'em
not. That they were not Originally in the Lxx. will appear, if we conſider,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:40622:34"/>
1. That <hi>Jerome,</hi> who tranſlatrd both the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and Lxx into <hi>Latine,</hi> takes no
notice of them, which doubtleſs he would have done, if they had been either in the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Copies: he had the genuine Copies of the Lxx, out of <hi>Origen</hi>'s
<hi>Hexapla.</hi> It may be therefore preſum'd, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> found theſe words in
ſome corrupt Copy of the Lxx, which <hi>Jerome</hi> calls <hi>verſio</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as we obſerv'd
before.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Latine Verſion,</hi> which all allow to be Ancient, has 'em not: No more are
they to be found in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> or any other Copies of the Lxx at
this day; nor in the <hi>Arab, Ethiopic</hi> (which follow the Lxx in moſt things) nor in
the <hi>Syriac</hi> or <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe. Have the <hi>Jews</hi> been able to corrupt all the
Copies of theſe Verſions, that were in the hands of Chriſtians? Did the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
treacherouſly deliver up all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Bibles, which were innunte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
to be corrupted by the <hi>Jews?</hi> If we ſhou'd ſuppoſe 'em to be able to alter
their own <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, is it peſſible they ſhould be able to falſifie all
the Bibles through the whole Chriſtian World? <hi>Credat Judaeus Apella!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Is it likely that ſuch a clear Prophecy concerning the Croſs of Chriſt had been
over-lookt in the New Teſtament, where ſeveral more obſcure ones are Cited,
and applied to his Paſſion? There's ſcarce a circumſtance of his Sufferings but the
Evangeliſts apply ſome Old-Teſtament-Prophecy to it, and they uſually note, that
ſuch an Event happen'd for the <hi>fulfilling of the Scriptures.</hi> Now had there been
ſuch a Prediction as this upon Record, that <hi>the Lord ſhou'd reign from the Wood,</hi> it is
highly probable, That Chriſt and his Apoſtles wou'd have taken notice of it, as
they do of thoſe that are more dark and abſtruſe. This Omiſſion is a plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
That it was not in the Bible in Chriſt's and the Apoſtle's time; and if not
then, it never was in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, which the Rector allows was not corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any <hi>material thing</hi> before the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Mr. <hi>Nich. Fuller,</hi> who has a learned Diſſertation upon this Subject, conceives,
that ſome Chriſtian, obſerving that theſe Words, <hi>the Lord reigneth,</hi> treated of the
Kingdom of Chriſt, added in the Margin by way of Explication, <hi>from the Wood,</hi>
which the next Tranſcriber, taking it for a various Reading, boldly incerted into
the Text, and ſo it might eaſily ſpread into more Copies, than the few the Rector
mentions, as <hi>ye</hi> and <hi>we</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. hath done. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> quotes <hi>Faber,</hi> ſaying, that
theſe words are not <hi>de Hebraica veritate,</hi> but added by <hi>Chriſtian Devotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will conclude with</hi> Fuller<hi>'s Cenſure,</hi> An verò os aliquod impurum dicere auſit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But dare any foul mouth affirm, that either thoſe Verſions <hi>(Gr. &amp; Lat.)</hi> or the Catholick
Church (which hath approved them for ſo many Ages) have conſpired in ſo horrid a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with the perfidious enemies of Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>Full. Miſcell. Theol. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>The Rector believes upon</hi> Voſſius<hi>'s Judicious Authority, that the</hi> Hebrew
Chronology <hi>is corrupted, his Argument is this,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> believ'd their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> wou'd
come about the 6000 Year from the Creation; that the World was 6000 Years old when
Chriſt came; that the Ancient <hi>Hebrew Copies</hi> reckoned 6000 Years from <hi>Adam</hi> to
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> elſe the Jews cou'd not have expected the Meſſiah when <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born, if their
Chronology had been the ſame as it is this day; from the whole it muſt be confeſſed, that
the Modern <hi>Hebrew Copies</hi> are corrupted, the World, according to them, being at the Birth
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> but about 4000 Years old. <hi>p. 25 &amp;</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>The Rector barely propoſes this Argument, but neither explains nor attempts to
prove the parts of it. I'll briefly examine each of them.</p>
               <p>1. It cannot be prov'd that the Ancient Jews expected their Meſſiah about the
6000 Year of the World. <hi>Voſſius</hi> endeavours to prove it from a <hi>Talmudical Tradition,</hi>
which the Jews aſcribe to <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Voſſius</hi> believes to be <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Tradition of the houſe of</hi> Elias <hi>is this,</hi> The World ſhall laſt Six Thouſand
Years; two Thouſand Years before the Law, two Thouſand Years of the Law, and two
Thouſand Years of the time of the Meſſiah; but for our iniquities, which are many,
thoſe Years are paſs'd and lapſed. Mundus conſtrabit, <hi>&amp;c. In Tract. Sanhedr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:40622:35"/>
                  <hi>Iſ. Voſſius</hi> begins theſe 6000 Years from the Floud, and ſo reckons forward to the
Birth of Chriſt; but he ought to begin from the Creation, for the <hi>Tradition</hi> ſpeaks
of the Age of the World, that it ſhou'd laſt ſix thouſand Years, alluding to the
<hi>ſix days of the Creation,</hi> accounting 1000 to anſwer each day. His reaſon for reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
from the Floud, is taken from <hi>2 Pet.</hi> 3. 6. who calls the Old World, <hi>the World
that then was.</hi> This is nothing to the point in hand, for the Queſtion is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Antediluvian World</hi> may be ſo call'd, but whether <hi>Elias</hi> intended to exclude
that State of the World, or the time before the Floud, from being concern'd in this
<hi>Tradition.</hi> This neither is, nor can be prov'd. Now if we reckon the 6000 Years
from the beginning of the Creation, it's co-incident with the <hi>Chronology</hi> of our
<hi>Hebrew Bibles,</hi> which make the World about 4000 Years old when Chriſt was born,
and ſo doth this <hi>Tradition,</hi> for it aſſigns 2000 years before the Law, and 2000 years
under the Law, at the end of which it makes the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, This is a <hi>Rabbinical Figment,</hi> and no <hi>Prophecy of Elias,</hi> as <hi>Voſſius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
without proof. Perhaps the Author might be ſome <hi>Talmudic Doctor</hi> of that
Name. It gives a falſe account of the time before the Law, which was about 2450
Years, and of the time under the Law, which was about 1500 Years, and not 2000
as he affirms. Some have calculated the Duration of the World by this pretended
Prophecy, and have been ſo vain as to affirm, that the Laſt Judgment will be at the
end of 6000 Years from the Creation, grounding their Opinion upon this <hi>Rabbinical
Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, the Jews acknowledge that the time of the Coming of the Meſſiah is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paſt, <hi>tho' he be hid from them for their ſins:</hi> This is inconſiſtent with their
defalking 2000 Years from the Chronology of the <hi>Hebrew Bible,</hi> that they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the World the time of his appearance is not yet come.</p>
               <p>They are ſenſible enough, that the time of the Meſſia's coming is lapſed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſome of them may ſay to the contrary; and therefore they pronounce a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Curſe upon the Computers of Times, <hi>Malè pereunt</hi> (ſay the <hi>Talmudiſts) qui
temporum articulos ſuppetunt quibus venturus eſt Meſſiah. Let their Bones rot</hi> (ſays <hi>R.
Jonathan) who compute the times of the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It can't be prov'd that the World was 2000 years old when Chriſt came. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, which I have prov'd incorrupt, the World was about
4000 years old when the Son of God was manifeſted in the Fleſh. There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why we ſhou'd eſteem the <hi>Greek</hi> Chronology before the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles. It's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
to prefer a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> to the <hi>Original,</hi> the Streams to the Fountain. Even
thoſe that follow the Lxx Chronology, do not make the World 6000 Years old
when Chriſt came. <hi>Theophilus Antiochen</hi> and the <hi>Oriental Church</hi> reckon about 5507
from the Creation to the Birth of Chriſt. <hi>Ad Antolyc, lib. 3. Nicephorus</hi> reckons
5505. <hi>Eccl. Hiſt.</hi> I. 10.</p>
               <p>We are ſure the <hi>Greek</hi> Chronology has been either corrupted very early, or falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Lxx Tranſlators, for it makes <hi>Methuſelah</hi> to live 14 Years after the
Floud; hence came that famous Queſtion, where to lodge him all the time of the
Floud.</p>
               <p>Some held <hi>(as St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>obſerves)</hi> that he was with his Father <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated.
This they held <hi>(adds he)</hi> as being loth to derogate from the Authority of thoſe
Books, which the Church hath entertained into more renowned Authority, and thinking that
the Books of the <hi>Jews,</hi> rather than theſe, do miſtake and err. For they ſay, its not credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the <hi>Lxx</hi> Interpreters, which tranſlated at one time, and in one ſenſe, could err, or
would lye or err, where it concern'd them not; but that the <hi>Jews,</hi> for envy they bear us—have chang'd ſome things in their Books, that the Authority of our might be leſſen'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is their Opinion, his own he gives a little after,</hi> Let that Tongue be rather
believ'd, out of which a Tranſlation is made into another by Interpreters. <hi>And in the
next Chap. (chap. 14.)</hi> The Truth of things muſt be fetch'd out of that Tongue, out of
which that that we have is interpreted. <hi>Aug. de Civit. Dei, xv.</hi> 11. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40622:35"/>
It is true; the Fathers generally follow'd the <hi>Greek</hi> Chronology, and how cou'd they
do otherwiſe, ſince few of 'em were able to read the Bible in <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies did not reckon 6000 Years from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
as the Rector affirms. They reckon'd, as we do now, as appears by the Copy which
<hi>Jerom</hi> uſed, of which he gives this account, <hi>That where the Greek Tranſlation ſaith the
Patriarches before the Floud were ſo many years above two hundred years old, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat

old.</hi> So that the 100 years which are added to the lives of the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
in the Lxx Verſion (which make about 600 Years in all) were not in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

                  <hi>But ſaith the Rector out of</hi> Voſſius, The <hi>Jews</hi> cou'd not have expected the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>
when <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born, if this Chronology had been the ſame as it is this day.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs that <hi>Chronology</hi> was the ſame, and they had juſt reaſons to expect the
Meſſiah then, for <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks were at an end; the <hi>Scepter was departed from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;
John the Baptiſt,</hi> the <hi>forerunner</hi> of the Meſſiah had awakened their expectations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s main Argument (as the Rector calls theſe) being anſwer'd, what follows is
of leſs Conſideration: however, I will make ſome ſhort reflections on his two laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which are as follows:</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Cainan</hi> the Son of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> mention'd <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 35, 36. is left out in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 12.
which is a demonſtration ſaith the Rector, that the Jews have corrupted the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument has been judiciouſly anſwer'd by ſeveral Learned Pens, as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may ſee in <hi>Pool,</hi> to whom I remit him. <hi>Sin. Crit. in Luc.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only take notice of what Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> ſays to it. He affirms it
added to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text by Interpreters, for theſe reaſons: 1. No reaſon can be given
why it ſhould be left out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. 2. But a probable reaſon may be
given why it ſhould be added in the Greek, <hi>The Jews eſteemed the Seventy Souls that
went into</hi> Egypt, <hi>beyond the Seventy Nations of the World.</hi> This arrogant Doctrine
muſt needs expoſe 'em to hatred and danger amongſt the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> To avoid this,
the Interpreters added another <hi>Cainan,</hi> and <hi>five ſouls</hi> to thoſe Lxx in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s retinue.
They took care that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould not in the <hi>Greek</hi> Bibles find exactly the Lxx
Nations in <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. but 72 or 73, (if we reckon <hi>Eliſa</hi> alſo) as alſo not 70 but 75 ſouls
that went down into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame craft they us'd in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 8. which they read, <hi>according to the number of
the Angels of God,</hi> whence the compariſon between the 70 ſouls and the 70 Nations
took its riſe.</p>
               <p>3. Nothing more uſual with them than to add according to their pleaſure, <hi>Gen. 10.
2. Eliſa</hi> is added, and <hi>v.</hi> 22. another <hi>Cainan</hi> among the Sons of <hi>Sem.</hi> So that they
have added two <hi>Cainans</hi> to the <hi>Original Text,</hi> one the Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> the other the Son
of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> and Grand-ſon of <hi>Noah. Gen.</hi> 46. 20. they have added five Grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to the Sons of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and in <hi>v.</hi> 27. they reckon up 7 Grand-children to him.
Shall we believe the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles? Let Reaſon and the Nature of the
thing judge. If theſe 5 were with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family went down
into <hi>Egypt</hi> (and if they were not, why are they numbred among thoſe that went down
into <hi>Egypt)</hi> then muſt <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> at the age of 9 or 10 at the moſt, be a Grand-Father
<hi>Ephraim</hi> at 8 or 9. But how comes St. <hi>Luke</hi> to follow the 70, and to inſert this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<hi>Cainan?</hi> To that the Dr. anſwers,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote to the Gentiles, and therefore muſt follow the Heathens Bible in
his Quotations. 2. In the Genealogies he was to be a Copier, and not a Corrector.
If he had not inſerted it, the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were only capable of conſulting the <hi>Gr.</hi>
Copies, might have call'd his Varacity in queſtion; as to the other part of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy,
which had been extracted out of Tables and Regiſters not familiarly known,
<hi>Luke</hi> is a faithful Tranſcriber. Thus <hi>Jude</hi> mentions <hi>Michael</hi> ſtriving with <hi>Satan;</hi> and
the Apoſtle names <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Jambres (2 Tim. 3. 9.)</hi> they do not deliver theſe as
certain things, but refer to the common Tradition.</p>
